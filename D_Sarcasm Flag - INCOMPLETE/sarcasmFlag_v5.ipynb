      "In the draft Constitution of 2004, only Pashto and Dari were recognised as official languages of the State. \n",
      "\n",
      "The final version made concessions to other languages as well by adding: “The Turkic languages (Uzbeki and Turkmen), Baluchi, Pashai, Nuristani and Pamiri (alsana) are official language in areas where the majority speaks them. Thus, Article 16 provides for a three-language formula wherever necessary. \n",

      "Major Ethnic Groups\n",
      "Afghanistan has often been described as a tribal confederation, comprising of multi-racial groups and nationalities. The dominant group, both in economic and numerical terms, is the Pashtuns. Concentrated in the South and the South–east but settled in most regions, the Pashtuns constitute around 38 percent of the total Afghan population.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Tajiks, the second largest nationality, is estimated to constitute 25 percent of the total population and is concentrated around Kabul, the Panjsher Valley and the Badakhshan province. Apart from these two nationalities there are a large number of smaller groups such as the Hazaras (19 percent), Uzbeks (6 percent), other minor ethnic groups like Aimaqs, Farsiwans, Heratis, Turkmens, Brahuis, Baluchs and Nuristanis (around 12 percent). Among the tribally organized communities are the Pahtuns, Hazaras, Aimaqs, Nuristanis and the Baluchs. The non-tribal communities include the mountain Tajiks, Uzbeks,Turkmen, Farsiwans and Kohistanis. All these groups maintain their own distinctive culture and sense of identity.\n",

      "The traditional gender roles have developed within the structure of marriage and family. The most important duty of a man is to support and protect his family. His honour requires him to defend and control those elements collectively known as namus: zan, zar, zamin (woman, gold and land). Zamin includes both land owned by the family and the homeland of a broader kinship group—tribe or lineage. Men thus see women as the repository of their honour. Any sign of sexual misconduct is seen as a threat to the honour and strength of the family and the punishment may range from ostracism to death. The social customs through which male control is expressed are pardah and chadri. Some women especially in the Islamic movement, contest the reading of these customs as signs of male domination and reinterpret them as signs of female self-determination within Islam .\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a division of labour where women’s work apart from food-processing, child rearing, cooking and other household activity range from carpet weaving to felt making or for some agricultural family revolves around working in the fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "The family in Afghanistan shades off into larger groupings based on kinship and other components of identity based on kinship and it is common to describe this phenomenon by calling Afghanistan a tribal society. In rural areas (atraf) the district administration interact with the population indirectly, through officially appointed representatives (called malik or arbab) of units called qawm. Qawm is sometimes translated as tribe, but in reality refers to any form of solidarity or asabiyya. Qawm identity might be based on kinship, residence or occupation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Afghans are conscious of belonging to a larger entity which takes the form of more or less endogenous community or solidarity group (the qawm), whether its sociological base is either the tribe, clan, professional group (qawm of the mullah or barbers), caste (bari or Nuristani), religious group (Sayyad), ethnic group (Munjani), village community or simply an extended family. While the state claims authority over society within a territory, a tribe claims jurisdiction over a set of persons bound by kinship relations.\n",

      "Despite gaps in the relatively liberal city and the conservative-minded Country-side, the political system of Afghanistan has been dominated by a tribal aristocracy. The place of the Mohammadzai family as emirs and later kings of Afghanistan was crucial to the development of nationalism as the monarch was often regarded as a key factor in imbibing national feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      " For example, Zahir Shah (from 1933 until 1973), was successful in unifying the millions of urban educated as well as rural poor and demonstrated the intimate linkage among “modernization, nationalism and the institutions of the monarchy.” There is an inherent sense of the essence of their common culture based on religion and other cultural practices, which has sustained Afghanistan through years of conflict and displacement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Afghans may quarrel happily among themselves, but they stand together and assert their pride in being Afghan when outsiders threaten them. A sense of national identity does exist, elements of divisiveness notwithstanding. These resilient communities, are strong and quick to recover from any crisis with the ability to withstand hardships, and this is definitely of enormous value in the country’s post–war reconstruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kinship, Qawm, Tribe and Gender Roles\n",
      "Being a patrilineal society, Afghans generally identify themselves as part of an extended patrilineal family where the sons inherit the property of the father and continue to work on it in common. Such large undividedfamilies represent the ideal of most cultural groups, although in fact the nuclear family is the most typical of modern societies. Since property isuch society is held and inherited only by agnatic kin, clusters of such agnatic kin form close alliances to defend or expand the patrimony but also risk splitting over antagonistic factions over its management or division. Affinal kinship relations are, on the other hand, important mechanisms for mobilizing alies. But in societies where polygamy is practiced, it can create tremendous complexities. Ideal form of marriage includes arrangements where agnatic cousins marry their children to each other or exchange sisters whereby bride wealth remains within the lineage and also strengthens relations between the families.\n",

      "Afghanistan was always divided into distinctive communal,\n",

      "social system that emphasized loyalty to the local social group (qawm) rather than a higher-order abstraction like the state. The geographical barrier set by the Hindu Kush Mountains created a barrier between Kabul and the rural areas and retarded the development of centralized political institutions, which could only expand in power at the expense of local loyalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Language Factor\n",
      "The several ethnic groups of Afghanistan (Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Turkmans, Baluchis, Pashais, Nuristanis, Aymaqs Qirghiz, Qizilbash, Gujurs, Brahwuis and even Arabs) speak different languages. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, introduced with the “New Democracy,” named two official languages, Pashto and Dari, the name given to Afghan Farsi or Persian. However Dari remained the lingua franca of the country as a whole. Language was to remain a deeply contentious and divisive issue. An official drive to make Pashto more viable as a national language by creating one standard language instead of numerous regional dialects led to the creation in 1937 of a Pashto Academy known as the Pashto Tolaney. But the state-led drive failed to make Pashto, in any real sense, a competitor to Persian. Another reason for Pashto failing to rise upto the standards of Dari lay in the fact that not only was it difficult to learn compared to the simplicity of Persian (Dari) grammer, but also general animosity felt against the Pashtun political dominance and a clear sense of cultural superiority expressed by members of the Tajik, Turkic and other non-Pashtun groups. Repeated attempt by the state to foster the growth and spread of Pashto, however abjectly failed.\n",

Among Hazaras are members of every Muslim religious sect in the country: Ismaili, Twelver Shi’a, and Sunni. Altaic languages are also represented in the country by speakers of Turkic languages. The Uzbeks are Sunni who speak Uzbek, a Turkic dialect. Turkic languages are not in the same family as Indo-European languages (such as Dari and Pashtu). Uzbeks live in a large semicircular area roughly following Afghanistan’s northern borders, from Faryab Province almost to Feyzabad. Turkmen are another Sunni Turkic speaking group found scattered throughout the northernmost portion of Afghanistan along the Soviet border. \n",

      "The Kirghiz are also Turkic speaking and, until recently, lived in the Pamir mountains of the Wakhan Corridor. The Kirghiz lived it the high mountain valleys of this region, while another ethnic group, the Wakhi, occupied lowland areas. The Kirghiz are Sunnis. The neighboring Wakhi, or Mountain Tajik, are speakers of Iranian dialects. They are often Ismaili but, according to Dupree, some Wakhi Twelver Shi’as and Sunnis also exist. They generally live in the same regions as the Kirghiz but at lower \n",

      "Nuristanis are Sunni who speak dialects of Dari and often also Pashtu. They live in the Nangarhar, Laghman, and Parvan areas of eastern Afghanistan. The area where the Nuristanis live, Nuristan, was the scene of the first armed opposition to the Khalq government. Arabs are a Sunni group living in northeastern Afghanistan, primarily “in an arc extending from Maimana to Kunduz.” Here they speak a dialect of Farsi that is mixed with Uzbek vocabulary. Some scholars report that Arabic speaking Arab communities exist in the area of Balkh.\n",

Some scholars regard Pan￾Islamism as an attractive ideology, stronger at times with anti-colonialist fervour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contemporary phenomenon of “political Islam” in Afghanistan arguably has a basis in the traditional role of Sufism and the influence in society of the most prominent pirs (“saints”), together with the constant allure for the Afghans of the concept of jihad and martyrdom. Afghanistan’s contemporary Islamic movement has cohered around a new Islamic paradigm focusing on the concept of the state and legitimacy of power. \n",

Tajiks generally live in the west in the area around Herat, in the northwest interior, and (primarily) in the northeast of the country, although not in the Wakhan Corridor.

      "Islam and other religious identities\n",
      "The Islam in Afghanistan is part of an entire civilization and the source of universal values and ethics that give life a transcendent meaning. Apart from tens of thousands of Hindus and Sikhs, and a small minority of Armenian Christians and Jews in the major cities, all other Afghans are Muslims. Muslims are roughly 99 percent of the total population and around 85 percent of the Muslims are Sunnis of the Hanafi School. Most of the rest, including the Hazaras, the Qizilbash and some Farsiwan, are Imami (twelver) Shi’a’ia, as are the Wakhis of the Wakhan Corridor. \n",
      "\n",
      "In any review of nationalism in Afghanistan, it is important to study the role of Islam in Afghan society as legitimizer of authority, and at times rebellion too—under successive rulers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although from outside, Afghanistan, may appear as a remarkably homogeneous group, even if they did form a distinct social group, there is a basic divide between the Sunni Muslim majority following the Hanafi rite and substantial Shi’a Muslim minorities - mainly Imami Shi’a (Twelvers), but also Ismailis. The Sufi tariqas and their pirs (hereditary saints) have and retain today a wide following, and tribal custom is more important in many spheres of life than Shari’a law.\n",
      "\n",
      "In principle, the Shi’a faith is more unified and hierarchical than Sunnism. Religious dignitaries among the Shi’s enjoy extremely high prestige and influence because they either claimed descent from the Prophet (Saddad) and/or because of their reputation for learning or pilgrimage to holy shrines like Mashhad, Nejaf and Kerbala.\n",
      "\n",
      " The social and political significance of the Sadad in Imami Hazara society was so great that Kopecky (1982) goes as far as to say that it is not the Hazaras who integrate the Sadad population but rather the Sadad who manage to unite continually contending the divisive kin groups and tribes of the Hazaras, and other Imami groups, into a political unit.\n",

      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Challenges to Nation-Building in Afghanistan continues.... The civil war in Afghanistan (1992-1996) after the Soviet withdrawal led to the different regions drifting apart. The neighbouring states supported their respective warlords, politically, militarily and financially. The warlords, in turn, developed closer connections with these states than other parts of Afghanistan. This also had economic consequences as Barnett Rubin has shown that the different regions of Afghanistan were tied into the economic systems of the neighbouring states, while internal trade almost came to a standstill. Both scholarly and policy approaches to contemporary civil conflict have been dominated by the part played by identity issues. Another concern has been with the alleged erosion of moral and civic virtues by what is seen as an upsurge of irrational, criminal behaviour, if not of entire communities, then of social substrata who have taken control of them. Societal cleavages between competing ethnic, linguistic, religious, regional and economic groups frequently cause or exacerbate fragmentation, undercutting the concept of the nation and thereby posing a huge challenge to reconstruction and other aspects of peacebuilding. Peace-building has to address issues like ethnic hatreds by promoting rule of law and criminal justice, and building institutions to substitute local rule with guided good governance. Warlordism and Overt Conflict Generally in countries emerging from war, overt armed conflict may have come to an end but low-level violence continues for many years, involving former factions, demobilized combatants, bandits or militias. Besides fighting the remnants of the Taleban and Al-qaida, which remain dominant in the south of Afghanistan and has destabilized large parts of that region, the dominance of so-called warlords has also remained as a major security threat. The most prominent individual examples of these so-called warlords were Rashid Dostum, Mohammad Fahim and Ismail Khan, who became the archetypes or icons of today&#8217;s warlordism.</p>\n",

      "Darlings has scored a fair share of compliments from movie buffs. What amused me while watching this movie is the bold protection a mother gives to her soft-hearted daughter in life. Badru is still in her filmy world. Like any middle-class girl obsessed with a better tomorrow, she overlooks many of her hubby’s repeated psychic acts. That’s how you see her making buns and omelette for him after a crushed night.\n",

      "But Shamshu, the mother effortlessly played by Shefali Shah keeps a third eye on Badru’s husband Hamza. And that eye is constantly open to the next house where her daughter lives. Every morning both converse through eyes from two windows. If Badru seems low, Shamshu immediately calls and checks. Darlings’ statement lies in this simple act! Keep this routine with your children every day and ensure them a roof in odds discarding all social biases, you are done!\n",

      "Badrunissa, exceptionally portrayed by Alia Bhatt is still confused weighing the right and wrong between her mother and hubby. She respects her mother for raising her boldly as a single parent though her emotional quotient doesn’t copy her mother’s genes. Perhaps, she has fed the meek girl in her until Shamshu uncaps her real potential. For Shamshu could see her own innocent, volatile youth in her daughter. Shamshu’s first option is to send Hamza to jail. When her daughter fails her in that attempt, her dignity is at stake. Shamshu closes her emotional windows to her daughter. It reopens only when Badru is pregnant. Now, her surveillance is sharper. Killing Hamza is her first thought. Her bold and beautiful moves control us with conviction and we join the mission. Who has the audacity to steal your right to live a vibrant life? As the disappointed cop says – because you allow them to do so!\n",

      "Mother’s milk, often called as the superfood for babies, is one of the best gifts a mother can give to her child. Breast milk provides abundant nutritional components, antioxidants, enzymes, and live antibodies from mother, which can be easily absorbed by the babies. Some of these nutrients are best for the baby’s brain growth and development of the nervous system.\n",
      "Mother’s milk also reduces the risk of babies catching infections and diseases including cold, gut infections, ear infections, respiratory tract infections, allergies etc. as a number of antibodies present in mother’s milk are not present in formula milk.\n",
      "Breastfeeding is a great way for both mother and baby to bond due to the physical touch experience and this affectionate bonding during the first years of life helps reduce social and behavioural problems in later life. It can also help mothers burn calories so they can recover and get back in shape in a healthy manner soon.\n",
      "It is however very important for mothers to take a balanced diet while breastfeeding to ensure her and her baby’s nutritional needs are well met. One should focus on making healthy choices including variety of foods from all categories including seasonal Fruits, Vegetables, Pulses, Whole-wheat Chapati, Khichdi, Chicken, Eggs, Paneer, Milk. Some food products which are called galactagogues can help improve production of milk in the mother’s body. These include Ajwain, Methi-dana, Saunf, Til seeds etc. which are also good for the body’s iron, calcium and vitamin needs.\n",
      "A vegetarian should ensure choosing foods rich in iron, protein and calcium such as lentils, cereals, green leafy vegetables, peas, dried fruits including raisins. Citrus fruits can also be added to the diet as they help with absorption of iron in the body. For protein – soy products and meat alternatives should be taken including legumes, lentils, nuts seeds. Eggs are also a good option. \n",
      "There are a few foods/drinks which are absolutely a NO while breastfeeding. Alcohol should be avoided at all costs during the period when the mother is feeding the baby as it is not safe for the baby. Cut down on caffeine intake, avoid more than two drinks of caffeinated beverages.\n",

      "On August 5, The Probe reported the story of Bashir Ahmed Bhat, whose land was acquired by the Power Department to construct a power grid station in the New Theed area of Srinagar. Basir and his family told The Probe that the government forcibly acquired their land, and they were being compensated without invoking the central land rules. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, many central rules were still not enforced in Jammu and Kashmir. Under the Central Act – The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 – Bashir and his family were entitled to a larger compensation for the land the government acquired. \n",
      "\n",
      "Following The Probe’s story on the forcible land acquisition, the Land Acquisition Collector of Srinagar assured us that the government was ready to reassess the compensation to Basheer Ahmed Bhat under the Central Act. “Previously, there was no clarity about this new Act (LARR Act 2013) and its applicability, but now the government has instructed all the land acquisition collectors across J&K to ensure all the new land acquisition proceedings are undertaken under LARR Act, 2013. We were confused in the past, but now it is clear, and we will invoke the central land acquisition law to make payments to the affected landowners,” said SS Bali, Collector, Land Acquisition, Power Development Department, Srinagar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to The Probe, Bashir’s son Irfan Hashim said, “I am very happy that the government has now agreed to provide us fair compensation, but my request is that the compensation must be calculated appropriately. The compensation is being made as per the stamp rate of the area with 100 per cent solatium, but this is not the way to calculate it. The collector and the revenue officials must study the Central Act properly and then calculate the compensation. Our land has commercial value, and that should be taken into consideration. More training is needed for revenue officers in J&K on the LARR Act 2013. J&K Govt must consult other states on this if the confusion persists”. \n",

      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The report, which was submitted by the Standing Committee on Water Resources to Parliament, also examined the replies by the government on flood, erosion and cooperation with neighbouring countries on rivers. The Committee deliberated in detail on the situation in Assam and other flood-prone states of the country.</p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">In Assam, more than 4.27 lakh hectares of land was already eroded by the river Brahmaputra and its tributaries since 1950, which is 7.40 per cent of the state&#8217;s total area. According to a government estimate, the annual average loss of land is nearly 8000 hectares. Over the years, as many as 2500 villages have been wiped out, impacting around 4 lakh people across the state, many of whom continue to live on the embankments. Consequently, the width of the Brahmaputra river has increased up to 15 kilometres at some places due to erosion which has gradually increased over the years. A survey carried out between 1912-28 revealed that the area covered by the river was 3870 sq km which expanded to 6080 sq km in 2006.</p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Brahmaputra river is characterised by high mean annual water discharge, high sediment yield and seasonal variability. It is a braided channel with the presence of numerous mid-channel bars and islands called &#8216;Chars&#8217;, with most of them being temporary in nature that gets submerged during the monsoon. The estimated annual sediment yield of the river is 735 million metric tons of suspended sediment loads which are among the highest for all rivers in the world. </p>\n",

      "Street vendors are integral to our country’s informal economy. The Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown that ensued adversely impacted the lives of thousands of street vendors across the country. The central government introduced the PM SVANidhi scheme in June 2020 to provide financial loans as working capital to the street vendors to help them resume their businesses. But the scheme is fraught with multiple issues and has failed to achieve its objectives.\n",

Under this scheme, three categories of loans are given to the street vendors. The first is a Rs 10,000 loan. The second is a Rs 20,000 loan for people who have repaid in full the first loan amount of 10,000 rupees. The third category is a Rs 50,000 loan. Apart from that, the beneficiaries are granted a 7 per cent interest subsidy under this scheme. According to the government of India, this scheme covers only 75 cities, but all street vendors are not concentrated in 75 cities. They are there in every district of the country. There are more than 720 districts in India. Why has such a huge population been left out from availing the benefits of the scheme?” asks Venkatesh Nayak, Director of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative.\n",

Even the US under the then President Donald Trump or Australia under former Prime Minister Scott Morrison had gone as far as to ban anything – least of all apps.

The Prime Minister claimed that demonetisation would help curtail the shadow economy prevailing in the country, curb black money, increase cashless transactions and reduce the use of counterfeit currencies. Nearly six years have passed since the demonetisation exercise, but the government has not been able to restrict the circulation of fake currencies.\n",

      "“One of the main reasons to go for demonetisation was to fight fake currencies. In the IB, we have done several operations and have seized fake currencies. In many cases, we found the fake currency racketeers were printing the currencies using actual high-quality paper. These racketeers have been purchasing the paper from the same dealer where the government was procuring the supplies. After that, several steps were initiated by the government to curb these practices, but it is very concerning that despite demonetisation, we are still witnessing so many cases”, says Rajinder Kumar, former Director, Intelligence Bureau (IB).\n",

Instead, they all feared waving the red flag considering the political and criminal muscle smuggling kingpins flexed. After all, the illegal trade’s worth was estimated at hundreds of crores of rupees. And ongoing investigations have pointed to the involvement of the high and mighty.\n",

      "The recent arrest of Anubrata Mondal, the Birbhum district president of West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), further highlights political involvement in this illicit trade. As per the CBI, Mondal, along with corrupt BSF and customs officials, was allegedly running a cattle smuggling racket. The TMC strongman, often called the ‘uncrowned king of Birbhum’, had been evading CBI summons for some time. He even sought medical attention at SSKM Hospital. However, the doctors advised Mondal to continue medication, and that hospitalisation was not necessary. The Probe had earlier reported how the SSKM hospital was embroiled in a controversy over ‘medical asylum’.\n",

      "Three years ago, on August 5 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, much to the shock and chagrin of the Kashmiris and many others, abrogated articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian constitution and ended the special status of the State of Jammu & Kashmir and symbolically merged it with the rest of the country. To be fair to the ruling party, the annulment of the Articles had figured frequently in BJP’s poll manifestoes over the last many years. A past president and founder of the party’s precursor, Jana Sangh, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, had died in detention in Kashmir while demanding the state’s integration with the rest of the country way back in 1953.\n",

It started off with reading down the two constitutional articles that guaranteed J&K a special status. A year later, on the same date, i.e. August 5, the BJP government fulfilled another promise: it began the construction of the Ram Temple.\n",

      "The government claims great success in Kashmir in view of the August 5 decision. It claims that the incidents of violence have come down by 88 per cent since the decision was taken and that there has been a jump in the number of tourists showing up in the valley. In other words, the state’s economy is booming, and life has returned to normal. But these lofty claims merit a query. If what the BJP claims is indeed true, why did the Kashmiri Pandits begin to flee the valley? What about reports of militancy becoming totally indigenous?\n",

      "RTI activist Mushtaq Ahmad has been closely following the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) for many years now. Last year, he met Mukhti Begum, a resident of Budgam District in Jammu and Kashmir, who told him that she had not received the LPG connection, but her name figured in the beneficiaries list of the Ujjwala scheme. After verifying the papers, Mushtaq went on social media and narrated Begum’s story, which went viral. Subsequently, within a span of 24 hours, the local LPG dealer in the area met Begum and gave her a free gas cylinder, stove and regulator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, Mushtaq and his activist friends have met numerous people in Kashmir who have faced similar issues like Begum, if not worse. Mukhti Begum and her family members wanted the local administration to thoroughly probe what they call “the LPG scam”. Several months have passed since the incident, but the government is yet to give clarifications. Mukhti Begum passed away this January.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the Modi government announced that the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana would get free cooking gas (LPG) cylinders for three months. “We gave gas cylinders to the poor. The poorest of the poor who didn’t have the right to clean cooking medium, we gave them LPG cylinders. We gave it to nearly 8 crore BPL families who had kitchens full of smoke. The Ujjwala scheme benefitted them as they got free gas cylinders for their houses. Now for those Ujjwala scheme women, so that they don’t run short of the cooking medium during this period when there is disruption, for three months, they will be provided free cylinders, and this is expected to benefit 8.3 crore BPL families,” said Finance Minister speaking to the Press in March 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though this promise was made in 2020, during the course of our investigation, we found that several families could not avail the benefits of this programme. The names of many women were written as beneficiaries of the scheme, but it was limited to paper alone. \n",

      "Three years ago, on this day, the Government of India abrogated Article 370. With this, the government scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. \n",
      "\n",
      "On August 5, 2019, the Union Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019 in the Rajya Sabha and eventually, the status of Jammu and Kashmir as a state was converted into two separate union territories. The two UTs – the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the union territory of Ladakh came into existence on 31 October the same year, and the day was marked as the National Unity Day. It is also a day celebrated to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel, who played a major role in the integration of India. \n",
      "\n",
      "​​Three years have passed since the abrogation of Article 370. Still, the ordinary resident of J&K continues to fight long and arduous legal battles to avail the rights they ought to have under the central laws of the government of India. \n",
      "\n",
      "During our investigation, we met with many people whose access to the central laws was cut and old and archaic laws were imposed on them. Let’s take a look at Bashir Ahmed Bhat’s story. Bashir runs a small grocery store in Srinagar’s New Theed (Haripora) village. Bashir, who comes from a poor lower middle-class family, did not have the means to get an education. But he wanted to get his children educated. The proceeds from the grocery store helped Bashir and his wife Mumtaz to provide quality education to their three children. \n",
      "\n",
      "His elder son Irfan Hashim completed his PHD in Journalism a few months ago from Kashmir University, and his second son Umar Bashir is a doctor with an MD in Medical Oncology. Bashir’s daughter Saima was married a few years back and is a postgraduate in Environmental Science. \n",
      "\n",
      "For many years Bashir had been planning to renovate his grocery store and expand his small business, but he spent all his savings on his children’s education. Kashmir is a small valley surrounded by mountains with very small patches of agricultural land. \n",

      "In 2013, visual artist, filmmaker, and psychotherapist Stephen Rudder was wrestling with negative portrayals of Black people in the media. “All the stories that I heard at the time were either violent or sexualised”, he says. “There's just something about Black men that I was trying to work out for myself anyway, so I wanted to research that and how they interacted with mental health, and I naively just didn’t know what was going on. When I did the research, I was kind of shocked.”\n",
      "In the UK, Black people are four times more likely to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act, 17 times more likely to be diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, and more likely to experience poor outcomes from treatment than any other racial and ethnic groups. These alarming findings sparked a fire in Rudder and caused significant changes to his personal and professional life.\n",
      "“I was getting a bit fed up with my practice anyway”, he says. “I was doing a lot of [film] work for UNESCO, museums, and cultural institutions [where] people just don’t really allow you to just express yourself. So, I put together a proposal to make a piece of film and applied for some funding from a kind of well known scientific funding organisation, but it was turned down”. Rudder had aimed to document and get to the root of why Black people, men in particular, faced such inequalities in the mental health system. Despite being assured of success by a grant funding writer, his idea fell victim to racist barriers and gatekeepers who labelled the project as biased. As a result of that rejection, Rudder decided to train as a psychotherapist as he believes it's important for clinicians to have a deeply personal understanding of the lives of those affected. “Often we hear about Black men's mental health but it's not from the voice of the people”, Rudder adds. \n",

This one time, I went out to get the clicks of my verandah after rain, I fell in love with how fresh and lively everything around looked. From the smell of soil to half drenched dogs playing in water, it almost seemed like, suddenly, all the living creatures got back their purpose of life. It instilled a pause in this world of rush and crowd, which even made me wonder, \"Escape, and find who you truly are\". Maybe, still the girl who loves to make paper boats and release them in water, curious about  how far it might travel and embracing the happiness it feels within. The girl who didn't judge herself through other's lenses of perfection and letting things go the way she wanted. This  all reminded me  why exactly I did start clicking pictues. Perhaps, there I had my answer. And before  I knew, I became obsessed with this weather, the wind, the clouds, the sky and,as usual, began my insane attempts of trying to photograph everything I could. Because amidst all this, it felt like these few droplets of water were much more than another phase of season change.  Definitely, there's something magical about rains, afterall when everything became standstill for moments, I found the serenity, I had been chasing since so long.\n",
      "It was the last evening of the most perfect summer vacations I had, I was comfortably lounging in my bed, watching cartoons when Mum asked me clean up my room. I murmured, \"Soon, I'll be sixteen and I'll not take commands from anyone!\", being the typical teen, and got up to clear the mess I had made. I still had the toys I used to play with when I was five, the scribble books and maybe perhaps all those things that made up my childhood. And suddenly I came across my photo album, all the clicks taking me back to down the lane even before I was born. I saw Mumma, how beautiful she looked in her marriage photos and how lively she used to be when she was young. I looked into a few more pictures and cleaned up my entire room. Then I went to sit with Mumma, maybe after a real long time. I didn't say or ask anything, just observed her face and saw how that \"young girl\" charm has disappeared. \"She was really fond of sports but left when I was born, so that I could have her undivided attention. I had asked her once that why she never went back to playing any sport again and she smiled, \"You're the biggest trophy I've. What prize could possibly match this grace, even if I win every game!\" You see, that's it. That's how selflessly she gave up on the very thing that made her the happiest even without thinking twice for another living being who might not do the same, if asked.\" While I was thinking all this, I realised I had been staring at her too long, I got up and went back to my room. I used to think how foolish it was of her to revolve her entire life around my and interfere with everything I do, but that evening all those toys, photos, kept safely preserved made me realise, it's her happiness she prioritized, that she found in me. And maybe life always isn't about materialistic joys, sometimes, its the smile, love and proximity of our loved ones.\n",

      "\n",
      "Usually every team have a back 4 or 3 defender line as shown with yellow line in the picture. If any attacker is already crossing the opponent defence line before the pass is played then the player is considered as in an offside position. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is why there are always three referees on the field, the main referee in the field and two on the sidelines called as the Linesman.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Offside rule is one of the controversial rule as it is hard for the linesman to judge minute centi meters of distance between strikers and defenders.

      "\n",
      "The different Types of Goalkeepers are -\n",
      "\n",
      "THE SHOT STOPPER - \n",
      "\n",
      "Goalkeepers who are specialise in making saves and blocking the ball from hitting their net are known as shot stoppers.\n",
      "\n",
      "They accomplish this by making acrobatic saves and predicting the angle and power of shots by opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shot stoppers often have excellent athleticism, reflexes, and arm movements as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of committed shot stoppers don't have well developed technical ability because saving shots is their main responsibility.\n",

      "Therefore a sweeper goalkeeper differentiates from the a ball playing goalkeeper in that the one is very at comfortable exiting their penalty area and moving infield to intercept the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, this enables their team playing with 11 outfielders instead of 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweeper keepers are famous for reading the game, running out of their box to clear the ball when the opponent throws long passes, and helping in build-up play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a great sweeper keeper demands not only technical skill and shot-stopping abilities, but also extraordinary calmness.\n",

In the past, Khatamband was home to shrines, palaces, houseboats, and royal residences. The best specimen of this craft is most likely found at Khwaja Naqshband's shrine.\n",

      "The Khatamband ceiling can be simply removed and reassembled at a different location with fewer or no nails used. Khatamband is now valued in Kashmiri society as a form of status symbol, and its insulation from the cold increases its appeal. Whatever the cause, the resurgence of interest has prevented the end of a long-standing custom. The distinctiveness of this work of art lies in the distinctive geometric pattern that develops once the ceiling is finished.\n",

His helpers produce the white and blue inks in the meantime by combining some kerosene with sand from the Jhelum River. A paper weight is placed on top of the tracing paper after it has been carefully laid on the fabric. A duster soaked in ink—blue for dark-colored fabrics and white for light-colored ones—is then passed. As a result, these pieces of simple cotton are covered in prints of paisleys, Kashmiri flowers, and chinar leaves. The second stage of casting the \"Chaamp Traavun\" is to use the create the beautiful embrioidery\n",

      "A Tilla craftsman is then given the imprinted cloth, who uses two threads—one staple and the other Tilla—to embroider the plain canvas waiting for his strokes. Utilizing a specific needle and concealing cotton thread, the Tilla is threaded over the fabric using this technique to create a flawless and long-lasting delicacy. In order to produce the required thickness for the needlework to be done, malleable copper is utilised as an underwire in the Tilla thread and coated with silver or gold colours. \n",

According to popular belief, Allah commands Ibrahim to leave his wife Hajar and their infant son Ismail alone in the desert between these little hills when they arrived in Makkah with him. Hajar was first apprehensive about spending time alone in the desert, but after learning that it was God's will, she put her faith in Allah and consented to the arrangement.

In her haste to obtain water, she first scaled the nearest hill, Safa, to get a view of the area. She looked about when she didn't see anything in an effort to find someone or a water source before running toward Marwa.

At first glance it may appear as though he eventually became broken again his messy hair, uneven moustache and drinking habit we see.  When in conversation with the other detectives leads us to believe that he fell off the wagon but that isn't true. He may drink to drown out his pains but he stays focused he continues to look for answers until he's able to bring down the yellow king ultimately True Detective reveals to us how deep the problems facing this area of Louisiana go, we learn about corrupt politicians a self-serving state and how all of these are the root of the problem however there are also the roots of poverty, crime and violence. It's a problem that is institutionalised there are signs literally littering the landscape that bear the mark of the man they're looking for and doesn't stop at an individual level, instead it extends itself into every part of society.\n",
      "I want to start off by looking at Marty of what we see from him in the first few episodes. He looks like  just a regular type dude. He's hard-working loves his wife, is at times overprotective of his daughters, is religious and hates the way the world is. He tries to help an underage prostitute by giving her money to start a new life, do something else even though he does all these good things he still does his fair share of bad things. He's an adulterer, he doesn't pay his wife and daughters the attention they need or deserve and can be a violent alcoholic. He is someone who doesn't have a full understanding of the world around him nor does he understand who he really is, despite both of these he still tries to change the world and to make it a better place when he really should at least at first be focusing on himself and his family and what is really important. In one scene he walks in on his daughters playing with dolls in a rather suggestive way instead of confronting the problem he chooses to walk away, later after his daughter Audrey draws a series of sexual pictures in school he again chooses not to confront the problem. Soon this problem starts to escalate and years later when Audrey has a less than ideal sexual encounter, a deputy found her parked in a car with two boys, he becomes violent and upset with her. Even though he's part of the problem for not doing anything earlier, this storyline with his daughter acts as a great microcosm of his entire character. He's willing to do the least amount of work required to get something done. He never looks closer into anything, he just accepts what is presented to him, that changes when he is taken out of his comfort zone once his wife leaves him and once he leaves the force he stops seeing everything so cut and dry he starts to look closer and explores more but most importantly he finds out who he really is.\n",
      "Throughout True Detective season one that is we constantly see decay, this place is like somebody's memory of the town and the memories fading just like Russ says. This can be found from the very first episode and the concept is introduced to us when we see the city, vacant industrial buildings, signs on the side of the road showing off missing people, crime and almost nothing good within this landscape. In this bright bright environment exists darknesses but this decay isn't limited to the city it stretches much further than that and the people the culture and ultimately our two protagonists. But True Detective takes it a step further than that, suggesting that everything bad that we see throughout is caused from the decay of morality.\n",
      " \n",
      "Of the utmost importance to True Detective is the location. We spend almost the entire season in and around rural Louisiana, venturing into swampland and other areas far from society it creates a timeless feel to the story although the narrative unfolds over a period of 17 years with a segment in 1995, 2002 and another in 2012. The world itself feels consistent, some characters change but the location always stays the same. More importantly over the course of the series the conflict is always the same two detectives trying to catch a monster. The show's location stays constant all the while corrupting people around it. Over the course of the show we watch as characters slowly lose their morals, nothing means anything to them anymore, they just start to exist. People turn to crime, to violence, to drugs anything that will give their life purpose. But ultimately find none. This is reflected in the show's opening title sequence, we watch as these swamp lands and rough looking industrial buildings melt into the protagonists and other characters ultimately corrupting them. I think what true detective does best and what it is able to do so well because of its eight hour run time is to render and develop two broken protagonists who we as the audience are able to relate to and care for despite their flaws.\n",
      "Early on he made excuses, he lies to others but most importantly he lied to himself he told himself that he was a good person. It's only when he's able to realise that he's not, is he able to find out who he really is and improve his life. Sometime between 2002 and 2012 after his wife left him he was finally able to change, he found a new purpose in life trying to make the world a better place, his change started back in 1995 when he executed Reggie Ladue, Russ commends him because for the first time he did something good finally starting to realise who he really is and this pattern only continued when he was taken out of his comfort zone.\n",

      "Comparatively, rust is someone who always knew who he was. By pulling himself away from society, Cole has a much more clear sense of his place in the world and what he doesn't want to do. He has an understanding of the purpose of life to combat evil, whereas there are two conflicting stages of Marty pre and post 2002, there are three stages of Rust and in these 17 years of the show we only see one the other two, being his time with his daughter and his time working in narcotics. We don't learn too much about who he was when his daughter Sophia was still alive, i don't want to dive too far into speculation but i think it's safe to infer that he had a positive outlook on life or at the very least more positive than when we meet him, he was able to stay in a committed relationship and was happy with his wife and daughter, upon losing his daughter he also lost himself in his faith that there is anything right in the world. During that time he loses faith in everything good he starts to think that people were just put on the world to suffer. This is when he worked narcotics and is brought into the company of some of the worst people imaginable and sees some truly horrific deeds and this changes him.\n",

      "This plan has infuriated and dismayed many Korean and international fans of BIGBANG, who think such an ad would be severely damaging for BIGBANG and their fandom.\n",
      "Korean fans are currently organizing to get in touch with YG Entertainment, BIGBANG’s agency, the ad agency in charge of the electronic billboard at the Myeongdong Red Eye Building, and the local civic body to prevent the ad from running. Their complaints state that the glorification of a jailed sex offender is against public morals and harmful to women’s rights.\n",
      "However, some international fans of the disgraced celebrity insist upon including him in all BIGBANG-related narratives saying that BIGBANG’s legacy was forged with him. This despite the fact that Seungri himself left the entertainment industry in 2019 and BIGBANG themselves have moved on from that, parting with a blockbuster comeback as four.\n",
      "In August of 2021, Seungri was jailed for a total of nine charges, including three sexual offenses. One of these was prostitution mediation, wherein he paid for prostitutes to be sent to potential investors in his businesses. Seungri remains in prison, serving out his eighteen-month prison sentence, reduced from three years by a High Court after he confessed to all his charges. Earlier this year, Instagram deleted his account under its safety policy, which makes the platform unavailable to sex offenders.\n",

      "When drinking with a much older person, it is customary to turn your head away to take a drink. Some Koreans may feel strange about a foreigner doing so, and they will tell you if that's the case.\n",
      "If you are smoking while walking along and you approach an older person, either hide or put out your cigarette. Korean teens that smoke typically do so in stairways and basement levels of buildings, away from adult's eyes. To westerners it seems sexist, but Korean women who smoke are seen as women of loose morals (if you get my meaning).\n",

Most Koreans wouldn't expect a foreigner to do this, but if you do it will make you look like a well-mannered guest in their country.\n",
      "Koreans shake hands and bow at the same time. The depth of the bow depends on the relative seniority of the two people.\n",
      "When you receive something (a present, a cup, a pen, etc.) from an older person, you should use two hands when receiving it, with a bow. If it's small enough for one hand, use one hand to receive it and the other under your forearm or your lower chest (for support). When you are shaking hands with an older person, use two hands. If the person receiving the gift is younger or lower in stature, passing with one hand is acceptable.\n",
      "Confucian tradition also demands that the elderly be treated at all times with the utmost respect. When elders are present, young Koreans would never lounge around, wear sunglasses, or expect to eat first.\n",
      "Relationships with friends are the one area where Koreans can view each other as equals. Friends, however, really means those born the same year who are, therefore, the same age and capable of being equal.\n",

      "\n",
      "3 Breast milk also contains antibodies and live white blood cells that help your baby fight against infection. And, when you or your baby are sick, the amount of these cells in your breast milk increases.\n",

      "4 Colostrum (your first milk) contains special proteins that coat your baby’s intestinal tract to protect from harmful bacteria right from the start.\n",

      "5 Your brain releases the hormones prolactin and oxytocin during breastfeeding, which help you to bond with baby and ease those normal feelings of stress and anxiety.\n",

      "6 The smell and taste of your breast milk changes depending on the foods you eat. Exposing your little one to more flavors during breastfeeding can lead them to be less picky eaters once you begin introducing solids.\n",

      "Hormones play a major part in a woman's life, and there are three transitions when the female body goes through major hormonal transitions: puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. \n",
      "\n",
      "At these three transitional stages, women may face different disease risks related to obesity and metabolic syndrome. \n",
      "\n",
      "Puberty is a critical period of development marked by dynamic biological changes. Increasing body fat and insulin resistance during puberty may increase the risk of developing a metabolic syndrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insulin resistance is a physiological condition in which the body cells become less sensitive to the effect of insulin, and high blood sugar levels, as well as increased secretion of insulin, try to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Insulin resistance may be the initiating factor for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular complications. It had been found that pubertal insulin resistance tends to be more severe in women than in men,14 which puts women at greater disease risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During menopause, biological and psychosocial effects accompanied by changes in hormonal production may affect women's daily activities and wellbeing. Menopause transition is associated with weight gain and a shift to abdominal fat distribution.15 This indicates the association between elevated risk of a metabolic syndrome and breast cancer among older women. \n",

But as you age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created, which may lead to weakened bones. Age isn't the only factor; gender, race, family history, and body frame size also affect bone health. The good news is that while you can't completely prevent some degree of bone loss over time, there are ways to strengthen your bones and decelerate bone aging.\n",

      "Water retention or edema, is caused by the build-up of fluid in the tissues of our body. Water retention is the primary cause of swelling in parts of the body such as legs, feet, ankles, under the eyes, etc. It occurs due to many reasons: excess consumption of salt, alcohol, a lack of fibre in the diet and insufficient consumption of nutrient-rich food, side effects of certain medications and a sedentary lifestyle.\n",

      "\n",
      "How do you know if it is a nursing strike ?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what’s a nursing strike? A nursing strike — or “breastfeeding strike” — is defined as a period of time when a baby who has been nursing well suddenly refuses to breastfeed. They usually don’t start this behavior until they’re least 3 months old and more aware of the world around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Babies who are entering a nursing strike typically refuse the breast but seem unhappy, fussy and displeased by not nursing. While your baby probably sometimes becomes distracted at the breast, pulling away or rooting in the middle of a feed is not indicative of a nursing strike, rather they’re just distracted. It’s the refusal to nurse for any duration that indicates a nursing strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, a nursing strike is mistaken for a sign that a baby is ready to wean. This is unlikely as babies rarely self-wean before 2 years of age, and when they do, they almost always do so by gradually reducing the duration and frequency of nursing sessions rather than stopping abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can cause a nursing strike?\n",

      "Babies can enter a nursing strike for a variety of reasons that are both physical and emotional. Some causes could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1congestion or an earache that makes nursing uncomfortable\n",
      "2 A sore throat, or a cut or an ulcer in their mouth that makes nursing uncomfortable\n",

Not only does this play a pivotal role in alleviating stress, but it also creates a positive, self-affirming relationship with oneself. Naps are an indispensable part of self-care as prioritizing one’s sleep is paramount in building holistic well-being. Taking long walks outdoors is another way of engaging oneself both physically and emotionally, creating pockets of peace and tranquillity amidst a busy lifestyle. Reading is a great way to practice self-care and creating a space for oneself to read and enjoy books is one self-care habit that builds mindfulness.”\n",

Products such as hair masks, Hyaluronic acid serums and anti-dandruff serums will help in strengthening the hair strands and beautifying the skin. So indulge in some retail therapy to stock up on effective hair and skin care products, so that you can create a relaxing pamper session at home to rejuvenate your body and mind, the next time it pours outside.\n",

      "The 4-7-8 breathing technique is a breathing pattern developed by Dr. Andrew Weil. It’s based on an ancient yogic technique called pranayama, which helps practitioners gain control over their breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When practiced regularly, it’s possible that this technique could help some people fall asleep in a shorter period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does the 4-7-8 breathing technique work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Breathing techniques are designed to bring the body into a state of deep relaxation. Specific patterns that involve holding the breath for a period of time allow your body to replenish its oxygen. From the lungs outward, techniques like 4-7-8 can give your organs and tissues a much-needed oxygen boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Relaxation practices also help bring the body back into balance and regulate the fight-or-flight response we feel when we’re stressed. This is particularly helpful if you’re experiencing sleeplessness due to anxiety or worries about what happened today — or what might happen tomorrow. Swirling thoughts and concerns can keep us from being able to rest well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 4-7-8 technique forces the mind and body to focus on regulating the breath, rather than replaying your worries when you lie down at night. Proponents claim it can soothe a racing heart or calm frazzled nerves. Dr. Weil has even described it as a “natural tranquilizer for the nervous system.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall concept of 4-7-8 breathing can be compared to practices like:\n",
      "\n",
      "1 Alternate nostril breathing \n",
      "involves breathing\n",
      "in and out of one nostril at a time while holding the other nostril closed.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, attentional resources are limited, and using them for one cognitive task leaves fewer available for other tasks (and, in turn, reduces available cognitive capacity). Given the overwhelming abundance of information at our fingertips and our brains’ limited capacity to process that information, we need to be incredibly selective with how we’re allocating our attentional resources.\n",

The attention will be on long jumpers and Tejaswin Shankar in high jump in Neeraj Chopra's absence, while Seema Punia and Navjeet Kaur Dhillon will compete in the women's Discus Throw Final. All eyes, though, will be on India's three Gold Medal matches on Tuesday.\n",
      "The Indian team at the Commonwealth Games 2022 had another outstanding day, winning three more medals—one silver and two bronze—and securing three more medals. In women's 48 kg judo, Shushila Devi Likmabam won the silver medal, and in men's 60 kg judo and women's 71 kg weightlifting, Vijay Kumar Yadav and Harjinder Kaur won the bronze. In the meantime, India guaranteed themselves at least a silver in the men's team table tennis, mixed team badminton, and women's fours lawn bowls events.\n",
      "On the final day of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, India added six medals, including four gold, to finish fourth overall with 61 medals (22 gold, 16 silver, and 23 bronze). The absence of shooting was expected to reduce India's overall medal count, but unexpected medals from sports such as lawn bowls, judo, and athletics mitigated the impact.

      "<p dir=\"ltr\">Enraged by the visit of Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US Congress and one of the most powerful leaders there, China's threat of targeted missile strikes on Taiwan's air and sea borders till Sunday is extremely worrying and after the Ukraine crisis is another great threat to world peace.<br></p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">It wouldn't be a surprise if this Chinese aggression turns into a major global crisis because Beijing's move is more about stopping the movement of ports in addition to stopping supplies in Taiwan. China has also said that there should be no movement of foreign ships and aircraft in this area till Sunday. In fact, when Russia attacked Ukraine earlier this year, it became clear that this would encourage countries like China to show aggression. It is not accidental that Russia has backed China on this, which was furious over Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.<br></p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The aggression of Chinese President Xi Jinping, though, is understandable. He is about to start a record third term as president a few months from now and in such a situation wants to record his name in history by embodying the plan to include Taiwan in China. But the major problem here for China is that the world's view of Wsthe 'One China Policy' that it is repeatedly reminding about to maintain its supremacy over Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet has started changing rapidly. That being said, China, showing its expansionist attitude around the world, cannot justify its dominance in Taiwan or Hong Kong in the name of the 'One China Policy.<br></p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">There also exists an undeniable reality that Taiwan, an independent island that China claims as its own, chooses its government, has its army, generates its revenue and has its passport. <br></p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">Nancy Pelosi was given a warm welcome in Taiwan and was bestowed with Taiwan's highest civilian honour and President Tsai <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iingwen/status/1554717272027336704?t=DgCKZQZ1h37xa6WBKXD63Q&s=19\">tweeted</a> that \"Democratic countries stand together in times of shared challenges\". Taiwan, although is not intimidated by threats from China, but condemning the Chinese aggression is not enough.&#160; Democratic powers around the world, including the US, will also have to do everything possible to ensure that Taiwan does not become another Ukraine.</p>\n",

      "<p dir=\"ltr\"><i>The 15 ends (rounds)match started in India's favour but then the former Champions South Africa came back strongly halfway through the match. The game post the equaliser after End- 12 quickly turned into India's favour again with a brilliant strategy coupled with a much-needed stroke of luck.</i></p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The final throw made all the four Indian players jump in joy knowing that they have not only brought gold to their country but along with that a new sport as well.</p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">Considering the girls didn't even get the needed resources, time and space to practice much before the games, this medal has brought hopes not just to India but to every sportsperson around the world who struggles all their life to compete and win at the highest level in the absence of any support system.</p>\n",

      "There is accumulating evidence to suggest a link between malnutrition early in the life cycle and risk of diabetes, obesity and other chronic degenerative diseases later in life.\n",
      "Recent research has suggested that risk to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and even cancer in adult life can originate as early in life as the womb. Sizes of baby at birth and childhood growth patterns are strong determinants of diseases. Both low birth weight & high birth weight and rapid childhood growth are associated with adult diseases.\n",
      "Besides, birth weight and later weight gain, certain micro-nutrients, proteins, amino acids, vitamin B12, folic acid even in the peri-conceptional stage can regulate metabolic characteristics and risk of adult diseases later.\n",
      "Post-natal nutrition including breastfeeding, protein intake in the first year of life, infant weight gain are also critical. Breastfeeding appears to have a protective effect.\n",
      "A hypothesis originated by Barker in 1989 called “Barker’s Theory” led to much research in this area. Today, a vast number of studies have documented the relations between fetal and / or later risk for cardio-vascular disease. With the epidemic of these problems, the focus shifted from simply lifestyle related westernized diets to study the potential role of pre-natal and early post-natal nutrition. This introduced the concept of the developmental origins of chronic diseases, and thereby the interest in this early life period has increased dramatically.\n",
      "There has been a shift in attention from focusing on later years to intra-uterine period (In the womb) in the life-cycle. It may be easy to accept the importance of intra-uterine period if we realize that almost three-fourth of cell divisions are over before we are born, that is to say, a newborn is almost a miniature adult. A new theory called “Developmental origins of health and disease” (DOHAD) evolved and is applicable to a number of modern day diseases like diabetes/hypertension/coronary heart disease/cancer.\n",
      "Damage suffered early in life leads to permanent impairment and also impacts future generations. This highlights the importance of nutrition, preventive health, education and socio-economic benefits. So, besides the burden of deficiency diseases, malnutrition early in life can become a burden for later years.\n",

      "Mother’s milk is best for the baby and the benefits of breast feeding are well-established. Breast milk is natural, easy to digest and is the gold standard for infant nutrition. It contains the right balance of nutrients that baby needs and helps boost your baby’s immunity. However, under certain circumstances you may need to consider formula feed.\n",
      "Exclusive breastfeeding is typically recommended for the first 6 months to be continued atleast for 1 year in combination with solid foods. Breast milk is sterile and does not require boiling, and therefore retains the goodness of its nutrients. It also prevents infections common in formula fed babies due to poor hygiene and unsafe feeding practices. According to experts from the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, significant compromise is made on infant’s health, as mother’s milk is substituted for formula milk due to various reasons in the first year of life when they are most vulnerable to infections. \n",
      "A recent study reported that only 69 percent of Indians below two months get exclusive breastfeeding and between 2 and 3 months, exclusive breastfeeding falls to 51% and declines further to 28% between 4 and 5 months of age.\n",
      "Besides optimal nutrition of carbohydrates (lactose), proteins, fats, iron and calcium, mother’s milk provides special immuno-boosting IgA and IgB factors not found in formula milk. These are believed to have life-long protective benefits on immunity.\n",
      "Infact, infant feeding practices have been found to impact several immunological conditions including celiac disease. Celiac disease is a condition where an individual is intolerant to gluten for life. Gluten is a protein found in cereals like wheat, oats, barley, rye and some others. An individual with this condition has to avoid these grains lifelong. Eating foods with gluten causes an immune reaction in the small intestines that can damage the lining of the intestines and lower absorption of essential nutrients leading to mal-absorption and nutritional deficiencies.\n",
      "A Swedish population study has revealed the relationship between infant feeding practices and Celiac disease. A three fold increase in Celiac disease was seen among infants from mid 1980s to mid 1990s-an unprecedented epidemic among children under the age of two.\n",
      "This provides a unique “window of opportunity” early in life to improve health in adulthood. Improving early life environment offers a new and exciting interventional strategy to control of the epidemic of obesity, diabetes and related disorders.\n",
      "In the Indian context, where under-nutrition and over-nutrition co-exist, integrated policies and programmes need to be designed with focus on maternal and child health. In other words, public health policies need to address the lifecycle rather than only concentrate on the end stages.\n",
      "Key messages:\n",
      "•€Children who are undernourished in the first 2 years of life and who put on weight rapidly later in childhood and adolescence are at high risk of chronic diseases related to nutrition.\n",
      "•€The prevention of maternal and child nutrition is a long-term investment that will benefit the present generation and their children.\n",

      "Otherwise carry your own food\n",
      "The study also showed a higher risk among children with infection. \n",
      "It has also been found that fewer breast-fed children develop Celiac disease, and, if they do, at a later age. The risk of developing Celiac disease decreased by 63% for children breast-fed for more than 2 months as compared with children breast-fed for 2 months or less.\n",
      "Breastfeeding has also been seen to have a protective effect when breast feeding was performed while gluten containing foods were introduced to the infant. The gradual or slow introduction of gluten containing foods like wheat into the diet of infants while they are still being breastfed is believed to reduce the risk of celiac disease in early childhood and probably during the subsequent childhood period.\n",
      "Weaning can begin at 6 months of age, when solid foods are typically introduced. Do not give your child cow’s milk until 1 year of age. Timing of\n",
      "introduction of gluten (wheat, biscuits, sooji) in infant diet is also associated with the appearance of celiac disease. In a recent study children exposed to foods containing wheat, barley, or rye (gluten-containing foods) in the first 3 months of life had a 5-fold increased risk of Celiac disease compared with children exposed to gluten-containing foods at 4 to 6 months. Additionally, large amounts of gluten at weaning are associated with an increased risk of developing celiac disease.\n",
      "Another research shows that infants at “high risk” or genetically predisposed i.e have a family history, who eat nothing containing gluten until after their first year can delay the onset of Celiac disease or, better yet, prevent it entirely. The fact that there is hardly any evidence of Celiac disease in predominantly rice eating nations like Japan points towards gluten as an the environmental trigger.\n",
      "Delay and gradually introduce gluten containing grains (including biscuits, cereals with gluten in the bottle) until six months to one year, while still breast feeding, and introduction of solids (weaning) without gluten containing cereals at 4 months.\n",
      "Clearly, breastfeeding seems to offer protection against several infections and diseases including celiac disease.\n",

Cresciuto nei vivai di Lazio, Roma e Sassuolo, Perilli ha debuttato tra i professionisti – in Serie C, nella stagione 2014/15 - vestendo la maglia della Pro Patria. Nelle tre stagioni successive matura ulteriore esperienza in Serie C difendendo la porta della Reggiana e del Pordenone. A partire dal 2018, e nelle ultime 4 stagioni, ha giocato in Serie B totalizzando 21 presenze in forza a Perugia, Pisa e Brescia.

      "\n",
      "Il perché risiederebbe nelle pretese del suo club. Il Feyenoord era fortemente interessato, ma avrebbe desistito a causa delle pretese economiche per il cartellino: 12 milioni di euro. L'appeal nell'ultimo periodo sarebbe ulteriormente calato nei suoi confronti essendo ancora a secco di gol dopo tre giornate di campionato svizzero. \n",

Un match incredibile, che ha visto il tennista altoatesino perdere il primo set al tie break, ma conquistare il resto della partita dominando in lungo e in largo: 6-1 6-1 il risultato degli ultimi due set. Il match è durato 2 ore e 26 minuti.\n",

      "Sinner vince così il suo sesto titolo, il primo in carriera su terra rossa. I precedenti erano stati tutti su cemento: Sofia Open (2020 e 2021), Great Ocean Road Open, Melbourne (2021), Citi Open, Washington (2021), European Open, Anversa (2021).\n",

      "Il problema al momento è la mancata cessione di Eldor Shomurodov. Il Bologna lo ha chiesto in prestito con un obbligo di riscatto fissato a 10 milioni  e a determinate condizioni per l'uzbeko. La Roma invece ne chiede 14-15 con obbligo senza condizioni.\n",
      "Questa sera, per l'esordio ufficiale del Bologna nella sfida di Coppa Italia contro il Cosenza, in panchina ci sarà Sinisa Mihajlovic. Il tecnico potrà esserci e non delegare ogni sua mansione al suo secondo, cosa che nel precampionato non ha permesso alla squadra di muoversi al meglio. Con Mihajlovic sarà tutto più diretto. Inutile dire che è uno dei leader, seppur non in campo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nelle amichevoli precampionato il modulo più utilizzato è stato il 3-4-3 ma è sembrato ancora troppo sbilanciato. Contro il Cosenza il Bologna si gioca il passaggio del turno in Coppa Italia quindi non potrà più sbagliare, come fatto ad esempio contro il Twente.\n",

Si conclude così la lunga trattativa che porta l'attaccante del Verona al Diego Maradona per 15 milioni di euro, distribuiti su due anni: il primo anno è un prestito con l'obbligo di riscatto.\n",

In Louis van Gaal e Massimiliano Allegri, per la prima volta in carriera, ho avuto due allenatori che non mi hanno inserito nella formazione titolare. Prima di allora ho sempre avuto allenatori che erano miei fan. Alla Juventus ho imparato che tutto deve venire davvero da dentro di te\".\n",

Ma alla fine Domenico Berardi è rimasto al Sassuolo, proprio quando sembrava essere arrivato il suo momento di trasferirsi in una big dopo tanti anni in neroverde. Invece no, i bianconeri alla fine sono arrivati a Di Maria e hanno abbandonato la pista Berardi, cosa simile il Napoli.\n",

Secondo quanto riporta l'associazione \"Ajax Life\" la società olandese avrebbe deciso di bandire i cartelli con cui i tifosi chiedono la maglietta ai giocatori.

      "Vista l'importanza della partita, non solo per l'avversaria, ma anche per mettere minuti sulle gambe in vista dell'inizio del campionato, sia Atletico che Juventus hanno la necessità di giocare un'amichevole.

Stefano Pioli ha le idee chiare e in un'intervista a La Gazzetta dello Sport parla a 360 gradi della stagione che inizierà ufficialmente tra poco più di una settimana. Sul fronte mercato secondo il tecnico mancano ancora un difensore e un centrocampista, ma per sostituire chi è partito non vuole dei \"cloni\": \"Sulla carta mancano due ruoli, il difensore e il centrocampista.

Ho chiesto di lui a Origi, compagno di nazionale, e lui: 'È metà Havertz e metà Kakà'. Giocherà qualche minuto a Vicenza e un tempo domenica con la Pergolettese.

La scuderia britannica non ha vissuto la sua migliore stagione nonostante i grandi investimenti per lo sviluppo di una nuova macchina qualitativa. Con Alonso si cercherà di fare il salto di qualità: \"La scuderia Aston Martin sta profondendo grande impegno ed energia per cercare di vincere ed è uno dei team più eccitanti nella F1 odierna.

      "Eppure quella di oggi doveva tornare a essere una domenica rosso Ferrari. La seconda e la terza posizione in griglia di partenza facevano ben sperare i tifosi del Cavallino. Alla fine invece la strategia adottata dalla scuderia di Maranello ha invece penalizzato ancora una volta Charles Leclerc, l'unico fra i primi cui siano state montate le disastrose gomme dure nel momento decisivo della gara. Il francese è arrivato solo sesto. Il compagno è arrivato a un passo dal podio. La sensazione è che la Ferrari abbia gettato alle ortiche una grande occasione.\n",

      "Il Psg ha alzato il primo trofeo stagionale battendo il Nantes nella Supercoppa di Francia. La formazione del neo tecnico Galtier ha calato il poker con un 4-0 che non ammette repliche. In gol Messi, due volte Neymar e Sergio Ramos. Buona la prestazione degli italiani Verratti e di Donnarumma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il match si è giocato in trasferta in Israele. Vivace sin dai primi minuti, si è sbloccato al 22' minuto con il primo gol stagionale di Leo Messi che ha segnato dopo aver scartato il portiere. Raddoppio al 45' con Neymar che segna una punizione tirata magistralmente da 25 metri di distanza.\n",

      "Questa volta l'Europeo è dell'Inghilterra. La nazionale femminile ha battuto la Germania nella finale di Wembley con un gol ai tempi supplementari della giocatrice del Manchester City Chloe Kelly. Le inglesi vincono il trofeo per la prima volta nella storia. Due i secondi posti, nel 1984 e nel 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "L'ultimo atto dei campionati europei è stato un match giocato bene da entrambe le formazioni. Il primo tempo si è chiuso a reti inviolate, così come la prima mezzora della ripresa. Poi ci ha pensato Ella Ann Toone, giocatrice del Manchester United entrata da poco in campo, al 62' a sbloccare la situazione. Il vantaggio dell'Inghilterra dura solo un quarto d'ora però perché Lina Magull, giocatrice di punta del Bayern Monaco, pareggia i conti al 79'.\n",

      "Si va ai supplementari. Basta il gol di Kelly a dieci minuti dalla fine all'Inghilterra per sollevare il trofeo.\n",
      "Ormai è divorzio in casa tra Cristiano Ronaldo e il Manchester United. Il campione portoghese ha giocato il primo tempo dell'amichevole contro il Reyo Vallecano, amichevole disputata dai giocatori che Ten Hag non aveva convocato per la partita più prestigiosa contro l'Atletico Madrid, poi è stato sostituito e, invece di rimanere fino alla fine della partita, si è fatto la doccia e ha lasciato lo stadio prima del triplice fischio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un gesto che Ronaldo aveva già fatto ai tempi della Juventus quando era stato sostituito. Sintomo che ormai il mal di pancia del portoghese è forte e la cessione sembra essere l'unica soluzione.\n",
      "\n",
      "La \"fuga\" di Ronaldo dallo stadio è stata immortalata da diversi tifosi che hanno pubblicato le fotografie sui social. Eppure sembrava che il numero 7 dello United fosse pronto a riprendere a giocare a prescindere da quel che accade fuori dal campo. Negli scorsi giorni aveva commentato una pagina dedicata a lui dicendo che \"il re\" sarebbe tornato domenica. In più aveva condiviso una foto che lo ritraeva con alcuni giocatori della squadra, cosa che non faceva da tempo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il tempo dell'addio sembra essere vicinissimo. Il problema è la destinazione, non ci sono squadre che si sono fatte avanti. Continua a tenere banco l'ipotesi Napoli, ma sembra per il momento solo fantamercato.\n",

      "I cori inneggianti a Putin da parte di alcuni tifosi del Fenerbahce durante il secondo turno di Champions League contro la Dynamo Kiev costano alla società turca una multa di 50mila euro. A infliggerla è stata la Uefa che ha anche imposto la chiusura parziale nel prossimo match europeo del club turco.\n",

      "Il gesto da condannare è avvenuto lo scorso 27 luglio nella partita persa dal Fenerbahce per 2-1 contro la squadra ucraina.

      "Wijnaldum è atterrato a Roma nella serata di ieri e oggi è il suo giorno. Prima visite mediche a Villa Stuart e poi la firma sul contratto che lo legherà alla società giallorossa fino al termine della stagione: con il Psg infatti è stato trovato l'accordo per un prestito gratuito con diritto di riscatto a 8 milioni. Quindi, se andrà bene, il giocatore belga potrebbe continuare la sua avventura a Roma anche la prossima stagione. \n",

I più acclamati, naturalmente, i due nuovi acquisti, Wijnaldum e Dybala.\n",
      "Il divorzio in casa tra Cristiano Ronaldo e il Manchester United è stato accentuato ancor di più dalle parole del tecnico Ten Hag che ha bacchettato il portoghese dopo che aveva abbandonato lo stadio prima della fine dell'amichevole contro il Rayo Vallecano perché sostituito a fine primo tempo. \"Un comportamento inaccettabile\", aveva detto l'allenatore ex Ajax riferendosi a Ronaldo. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lo stesso tecnico però potrebbe dare una maglia da titolare a CR7 domenica nella prima di campionato contro il Brighton. Non un attestato di stima, ma quasi un obbligo vista l'assenza per infortunio di Martial.

      "Il torneo di Cincinnati sta facendo vittime illustri, ma continua il cammino di Jannik Sinner. L'altoatesino al secondo turno ha battuto il serbo Miomir Kecmanovic. Anzi, per dirla tutta, l'avversario si è ritirato durante il secondo set per infortunio quando il risultato era sul 3-1 per Sinner che aveva già vinto il primo set 7-5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un match equilibrato in cui Sinner ha vinto il primo set grazie a un break conquistato al secondo game di Kecmanovic. Poi ha giocato bene quando ha servito mettendo a punto 5 ace e un impressionante 21/22 nei punti conquistati sulla sua prima di servizio. Nel quinto game del secondo set, quando l'italiano era sul 3-1, il serbo si è ritirato.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agli ottavi di finale Sinner affronterà il canadese Felix Auger-Aliassime che al secondo turno ha eliminato agilmente l’australiano Alex de Minaur con il punteggio di 6-3, 6-2. Sarà un match molto impegnativo per l'italiano.\n",
      "Nonostante i campionati siano ai nastri di partenza, e alcuni già iniziati, continua il calciomercato. Sul Milan incombe il Psg, interessato a portare a Parigi l’uomo più decisivo dello scorso campionato, quello dello scudetto, Rafael Leao. Il tecnico Galtier d’altronde lo aveva detto: “Sì, vogliamo che al PSG arrivi un altro attaccante. La società sta lavorando sodo in questa direzione, ma dobbiamo stare attenti: non dobbiamo prendere tanto per prendere. I giocatori da inserire in organico devono essere funzionali alla nostra rosa\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Leao è una delle due piste del Psg. L’altra è il giocatore del Manchester United Rashford. Per l’attaccante del Milan sarebbe necessario un assegno da 70 milioni di euro, cifra che a Parigi non avrebbero difficoltà a mettere sul piatto. In più ci sarebbe la carta di Diallo, difensore centrale che potrebbe interessare il Milan.\n",
      "Secondo Sky Sport il Milan avrebbe messo gli occhi sul centrocampista del Midtjylland, il nigeriano Raphael Onyedika. La notizia è stata confermata anche dal portale danese bt.dk secondo cui ci sarebbe già stata un'offerta del club rossonero di 30 milioni di corone danesi, circa 4 milioni di euro.\n",
      "\n",
      "L'offerta del Milan però sarebbe stata rifiutata perché il Midtjylland vorrebbe il doppio, 60 milioni di corone, cioè 8 milioni di euro. In ogni caso, sempre secondo il portale bt.dk, la società danese sarebbe disposta a trattare.\n",
      "A Roma ne sono certi. In settimana la Roma annuncerà l'ingaggio di Andrea Belotti, attaccante svincolato dopo sette stagioni passate al Torino. I giallorossi andrebbero così a completare il reparto offensivo con un campione d'Europa a costo zero. \n",
      "\n",
      "Belotti non ha avuto molte offerte nonostante fosse a parametro zero, una però gli era arrivata dal Wolverhampton che lui però ha rispedito al mittente. Sperava nel Milan, squadra interessata a lui un paio di stagioni fa, ma la chiamata non è arrivata. La Roma è un'ipotesi degli ultimi giorni che pare gradire molto.\n",

      "Classe 1993, il \"Gallo\" ha lasciato il Torino dopo sette anni, gli ultimi dei quali passati con la fascia di capitano al braccio.

      "Sembrava solo una voce di fantamercato, invece alla fine Casemiro diventerà davvero un giocatore del Manchester United. Il brasiliano a breve lascerà la Spagna per trasferirsi in Inghilterra, dove svolgerà le visite mediche prima di firmare per i Red Devils. La trattativa, non ancora ufficiale, è stata però confermata da Carlo Ancelotti in conferenza stampa: \"Gli ho parlato, mi ha detto di voler provare una nuova sfida. Comprendiamo la sua scelta\".\n",
      "\n",
      "L'allenatore Del Real Madrid ha continuato: \" Non c'è nulla di ufficiale, però si tratta della sua volontà. Casemiro ha capito benissimo cos'è il Real Madrid. A me è successa una cosa simile quando ero allenatore del Milan: sei molto bravo, ma arriva il momento in cui vuoi provare qualcosa di nuovo. E mi sono sentito molto bene in un club che era come una famiglia. È qualcosa di personale e lo capisco perfettamente”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il Real non tornerà sul mercato. Ancelotti lo conferma, nonostante a livello economico potrebbe visto che dalla cessione di Casemiro i Blancos incasseranno 70 milioni di euro. \"Se Casemiro se ne va, abbiamo sei centrocampisti. Con Casemiro ne avevamo sette. Penso che sei siano sufficienti per gestire l'intera stagione. Parliamo di sei giocatori estremamente forti\".\n",
      "Il torneo di Cincinnati rimane senza italiani. L'ultimo sopravvissuto Jannik Sinner, 12 al mondo, è stato eliminato da Felix Auger-Aliassime, 9 al mondo, in tre set in un match di quasi due ore e mezza terminato con il risultato di 2-6 7-6 (1) 6-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "L'ottavo di finale era iniziato benissimo per Sinner che ha chiuso il primo set sul 6-2. Nel secondo set però il match è tornato in estrema parità, almeno fino al tie-break dove Auger-Aliassime ha preso il sopravvento lasciando a 1 l'altoatesino.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sinner mal digerisce il ritorno dell'avversario e nel terzo set capitombola per 6-1. Auger-Aliassime giocherà i quarti di finale contro Borna Coric che ha battuto Roberto Bautista Agut agli ottavi. Coric è stato capace anche di eliminare Nadal al secondo turno.\n",
      "Nei prossimi giorni Icardi dovrà prendere una decisione. Restare a Parigi fuori rosa per i mesi avvenire oppure cambiare aria? Di squadre interessate a lui sembrano non essercene molte, anzi c’è moria a dirla tutta. Nemmeno la Juventus sembra essere minimamente interessata all’attaccante argentino nonostante la ricerca di un vice Vlahovic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Una soluzione in realtà ci sarebbe ed è anche la più suggestiva, già confermata da Galliani. Il Monza prenderebbe volentieri Icardi in squadra facendo anche un grosso sforzo economico. Ciononostante l’argentino dovrebbe abbassarsi di pareggio l’attuale ingaggio da quasi 10 milioni di euro netti a stagione. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Ventitré anni, Pellegrini è uscito dal settore giovanile della Roma. Dopo aver giocato a Cagliari e a Genova, nel 2021 è stato acquistato dalla Juventus con cui ha disputato in totale 18 presenze ed esordito in Champions League.\n",
      "Il Monza continua a fare acquisti. Oggi ha ufficializzato Andrea Petagna, attaccante che arriva in prestito oneroso a 2,5 milioni dal Napoli, con obbligo di riscatto a fine anno a 10 milioni di euro, che con i bonus potrebbe arrivare a 14 milioni di euro. Petagna era uno dei nomi sul taccuino di Galliani per rinforzare la rosa della neopromossa. L’attaccante potrebbe già esordire nel fine settimana contro il Torino.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petagna ha vestito la maglia del Napoli nelle ultime due stagioni scendendo in campo 50 volte e segnando 7 gol. Ha anche giocato 13 partite in Europa League. L’attaccante ritrova Galliani e Berlusconi dopo gli anni di settore giovanile nel Milan. Dai rossoneri era partita la girandola di prestiti che lo aveva visto giocare in serie B a Latina, Vicenza e Ascoli, prima di approdare all’Atalanta con cui matura. Alla Spal segna 16 gol in un campionato e alla fine è arrivato il Napoli. Anzi, il Monza.\n",
      "La vigilia di campionato per l’Inter ha un solo titolo, dato in conferenza stampa da Simone Inzaghi: “L’Inter ha chiuso il mercato. La squadra è questa, l’ho concordato con proprietà e società. Ci manca solo un sostituto di Ranocchia e la società e al lavoro per questo”. Quindi, a parte un sostituto per Ranocchia, i nerazzurri non faranno più né acquisti né cessioni, Skrniar compreso.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domani l’Inter sarà impegnata in trasferta contro il Lecce. Un test importante per valutare la condizione dopo un precampionato non certo scoppiettante. Una sola vittoria per 4-1 con il Lugano, due pareggi con Monaco e Lione e altrettante sconfitte con Lens e Villarreal. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"C’è tanta voglia di questo esordio”, ha detto Inzaghi in conferenza stampa, “Abbiamo fatto un buon lavoro in preparazione fin dal 6 luglio, disputando tante partite molte delle quali impegnative. Ma era quello che volevamo. Avevamo intenzione di misurarci con squadre più avanti di noi a livello fisico. La nostra paura era solo quella di perdere qualche giocatore per colpa degli infortuni”.\n",
      "L'avventura europea di Edison Cavani potrebbe essere arrivata al capolinea. Secondo quanto riportato da alcuni media spagnoli, il Matador è vicino a firmare con il Boca Junior. La squadra argentina avrebbe superato il Villareal nella corsa all'attaccante svincolato da fine giugno dopo i due anni trascorsi al Manchester United in cui ha segnato appena 12 reti.\n",
      "\n",
      "L'annuncio di Cavani dovrebbe arrivare nelle prossime ore visto che il calciomercato in Argentina si chiude l'8 agosto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cavani è in Europa dal 2007 quando, appena 20enne, venne acquistato dal Palermo di Maurizio Zamparini. Poco più di 30 gol in un centinaio di partite gli valgono la chiamata del Napoli con cui diventa un grande attaccante capace di segnare 78 reti in 104 partite disputate in azzurro. Solo 3 gli anni in Campania, sette invece quelli a Parigi dove segna 138 gol in 200 presenze. Ultima squadra europea il Manchester United con cui ha fatto le sue due peggiori stagioni in carriera.\n",
      "Per una notte è sembrato di rivivere Tokyo. Dopo Marcell Jacobs, anche Gianmarco Tamberi ha conquistato l'oro nel salto in alto. Una vittoria non banale visto che arrivava da un quarto posto ai mondiali e da un periodo di riposo forzato causa Covid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Invece Tamberi è stato più forte di tutto e tutti, saltando a 2.30 al secondo tentativo dopo quattro salti perfetti fino a qual momento. Altra difficoltà è stata la pioggia, ma il tedesco Potye e l'ucraino Protsenko, rispettivamente secondo e terzo, non sono riusciti a fare meglio di lui.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Che gara difficile, difficilissima\", ha detto al termine della premiazione, \"Quando ho visto che iniziava a piovere sapevo che non erano le migliori condizioni per me, sono saltatatore di velocità e con il bagnato scivolo. Ma mi sono detto o oggi o mai più, dovevo dare tutto dopo quello che ho passato. Sono contentissimo. Attraverso gli ostacoli mi stimolo, i salti più belli li ho fatti con l’Italia, questo azzurro mi dà una carica impressionante\".\n",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport, a meno di venti giorni dall'inizio degli Us Open di New York, ha intervistato Carlos Alcaraz, uno dei tennisti più promettenti del circuito ma che, negli ultimi tornei, ha patito e non poco gli italiani affrontati. Sconfitte pesanti quelle contro Berrettini, poi Musetti e due volte Sinner. In tutto, con loro, due finali perse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gli italiani mi hanno dato qualche dispiacere di troppo ultimamente\", ha raccontato il tennista spagnolo, \"Sono giocatori tutti molto forti e con caratteristiche completamente differenti.. Contro Berrettini sapevo a cosa sarei andato incontro, conoscevo il suo stile, con Musetti uguale. Jannik però mi ha sorpreso: per il modo di stare in campo e per il livello di aggressività che riesce a esprimere in ogni scambio\".\n",

      "A breve inizieranno i tornei negli States, compresi gli Us Open. \"Ora andiamo in America, lì ho vinto Miami e fatto semifinale a Indian Wells, l’obiettivo è giocare al massimo livello possibile e guadagnare tanti punti.

      "L'Inter perde l'ultima amichevole prima dell'inizio del campionato fissato per il prossimo fine settimana. Troppo fragile in zona difensiva e così il Villareal torna in Spagna dopo aver messo a segno 4 reti, 2 per tempo. In casa nerazzurra continua a segnare Lukaku, ma non basta, serve molto di più per fare paura alle altre squadre della Serie A. Il Villareal invece ha concesso pochissimo all'Inter, soprattutto annullando a larghi tratti il centrocampo che non è riuscito di conseguenza a servire gli attaccanti.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sloccare l'amichevole ci ha pensato Pedraza alla mezzora con una perla di esterno destro. Pareggia i conti Lukaku poco più di cinque minuti più tardi mettendo la palla in rete di testa su assist si Gosens. Prima dell'intervallo però gli spagnoli tornano in vantaggio: Coquelin approfitta di un pallone perso dal neo acquisto Asllani e trova il gol del vantaggio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nella ripresa la storia non cambia e il Villareal allunga subito le distanze ancora con Pedraza che batte Handanovic dopo aver sfondato sulla sinistra. A poco serve il gol di D'Ambrosio al ventesimo: l'Inter non riuscirà a trovare il pareggio nella mezzora finale, ma anzi subisce il quarto gol con Jackson a dieci minuti dalla fine.\n",
      "L'Italia non potrà farsi valere nella finale della staffetta 4x100 degli Europei. Il quartetto azzurro, per tre quarti diverso da quello medaglia d'oro alle Olimpiadi, inizialmente si era qualificata come ultima ripescata, ma dopo un ricorso della Turchia, accolto, è stata esclusa a favore dei turchi.\n",
      "\n",
      "In semifinale Lorenzo Patta, Wanderson Polanco, Matteo Meluzzo e Chituru Ali avevano chiuso in 39\"02. Il ricorso accolto della Turchia ha permesso agli atleti turchi di rigareggiare chiudendo in 38\"98 e di fatto superando l'Italia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un peccato, soprattutto il non aver gareggiato con il quartetto di Tokyo. Ma Jacobs ha dovuto rinunciare a causa del problema al polpaccio sinistro, Tortu è rimasto a riposo in vista della finale dei 200 metri, stesso discorso per Desalu.\n",
      "Le due categorie di differenza si sono viste tutte, ma il Milan comunque è in palla a una settimana dall'inizio del campionato. Un'amichevole quella con il Vicenza che ha visto l'esordio anche del neo acquisto, il belga De Ketelaere a cui Pioli ha concesso un quarto d'ora di partita. Stiramento invece per Tonali che è dovuto uscire a inizio secondo tempo e gli ci vorrà qualche giorno per rimettersi in forma.\n",

      "Per la cronaca, nel 6-1 finale, la prima squadra ad andare in rete è stato il Vicenza dopo 20 secondi. Rolfini di testa porta in vantaggio i biancorossi.

      "L’attuale assistente di Roberto Mancini in Nazionale, Daniele De Rossi, sarebbe vicino a iniziare la sua prima avventura da allenatore. Il Benevento starebbe pensando di affidargli la panchina sostituendolo a mister Fabio Caserta. La società non sarebbe convinta dall'attuale tecnico, soprattutto dopo la sconfitta all'esordio contro il Cosenza per 1-0. Secondo il Corriere dello Sport De Rossi sarebbe un obiettivo della società.\n",

Partita tutt'altro che semplice.\n",
      "L'amichevole alla Continassa giocata tra la Juventus e l'Atletico Madrid è stata anche un'occasione per le due dirigenze per parlare, ancora una volta, di Alvaro Morata. L'attaccante è tornato alla squadra che ne possiede il cartellino ma i bianconeri lo rivorrebbero portare a Torino. L'Atletico però chiede tanti soldi per venderlo, oltre 30 milioni di euro. Tanti, troppi per la Juventus che nelle ultime stagioni lo aveva avuto in prestito.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morata è stato anche protagonista in campo, segnando una tripletta nel 4-0 finale. Nel post partita le cose per la Juventus sono andate ugualmente male. L'Atletico Madrid non scende dalle sue richieste, anche perché Morata ha dimostrato di poter essere utile. E' possibile che la dirigenza bianconera ci metta una pietra sopra.\n",

      "The film was supposed to be watched on television, not a wide screen, so it lacked the kind of massive set pieces that may have boosted its score. The idea of launching straight-to-streaming DC-branded pictures looks to have been abandoned or at least jeopardised. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav cited Marvel Studios as a blueprint for DC's future in an earnings call. Greg Berlanti has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the role.\n",

Until that post is filled, Hamada will oversee DC Film under Abdy and De Luca, the latter of whom has impressed executives with his understanding of comic book arcana.\n",
      "The decision to discontinue \"Batgirl\" appears to have been the final straw, prompting Hamada to consider resigning. De Luca and Abdy persuaded him to stay at the studio at least until the October release of \"Black Adam\". The decision to keep Hamada appears to be totally up to the administration.

      "Walter Hamada, president of DC Films, is on the verge of leaving the company, sources say The Hollywood Reporter, amid the cancellation of the HBO Max film Batgirl and David Zaslav's apparent desire to find new leadership for the DC universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources with knowledge of the situation say that Hamada has finally consented to hold onto his position at least until the Dwayne Johnson movie Black Adam's release on October 21. He is pausing, according to a source. \"The choice to make this confrontational has not yet been made.\" Hamada was unavailable for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is conflict because Zaslav has promised to \"reset\" DC with a 10-year plan that he believes would enable the company to compete with Disney-owned Marvel Studios, which has created the largest film franchise in history. During the results call on Thursday, Zaslav stated, \"We think we can develop a much better, sustainable growth business out of DC.\" \"As part of it, our attention will be on quality. No movie will be released before it is complete. DC is something that we can improve.\n",

      "An insider claims that Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, the co-chairs and CEOs of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, who are in charge of DC until Zaslav decides on new management, told Hamada at a recent Black Adam test screening that Batgirl, a $90 million movie that was in post-production, would be shelved. The reason provided was that the film wasn't strong enough for a theatrical release and was too pricey for a streaming distribution considering Zaslav's strategy. The business decided to take a writedown on the project because it was under financial pressure to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a source with knowledge of the incident, Hamada was angry that he wasn't contacted and worried about the effect on the people working on the movie. The news of the film's cancellation was first reported by the New York Post on Aug. 2, before the cast and their agents had been told of the decision. The Post stated that a source called the movie \"irredeemable\" and that it received negative test scores.\n",

      "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" has collected $679 million in North America, enough to overtake \"Avengers: Infinity War\". It's the sixth-highest grossing movie in domestic box office history. 2018's every-hero-but-the-kitchen-sink adventure \"Infinity War\" had a little help in building up anticipation. \"Maverick\" had Tom Cruise, a box office hero in his own right, but moviegoers hadn't felt the need for speed in 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, thanks to stellar word-of-mouth and repeat customers, \"Maverick\" continues to defy the odds.  That's without playing in China or Russia, two major overseas markets.

      "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is Cruise's first movie to reach $100 million in a single weekend. Joseph Kosinski directed the film, which picks up decades after the original Top Gun film. Miles Teller, Glen Powell, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Connelly and Val Kilmer all star.\n",

      "\n",
      "The movie tells the tale of the painter and sculptor in Paris in 1916 and is based on the play by Dennis McIntyre that Jerzy and Mary Kromolowski adapted for the screen. Modigliani, who had previously regarded himself as a critical and financial failure, experiences a tumultuous and exciting 48 hours that will ultimately serve as a turning point in his life and confirm his status as an artistic legend. THR is aware that the start of production in Europe is scheduled for the spring of 2023 , with casting to be revealed shortly.\n",

      "\"I'm immensely thrilled and profoundly humbled to bring the saga of Mr. Modigliani's life to the movie,\" said Depp, who produces for IN.2, the European division of his production firm Infinitum Nihil.

      "Another European project for Depp is Modigliani as he seeks to resume his acting career after his recent and traumatic defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. The 59-year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star defeated Heard in a $50 million slander lawsuit earlier this year. While she did not specifically name Depp, his legal team maintained that her account of domestic abuse in a 2018 op-ed for the Washington Post showed that he had been aggressive during their relationship, something he vehemently disputed. Heard, 36, won one of her countersuit claims and received $2 million when the jury ultimately voted in his favour and awarded the actor $10 million.\n",

      "In its first weekend, \"Forrest Gump\" led the box office; the following week, \"True Lies\" took its place. Late in July, the film returned to the top spot for a week before being dethroned once more by \"The Mask\" and \"Clear and Present Danger.\" Then, for a third time during a week in August and a fourth and fifth time during two weeks in September, \"Forrest Gump\" topped the charts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It then went on to win the best picture Oscar for that year. Best picture winners with modest budgets and late-year releases, such as \"The Shape of Water\" and \"Moonlight,\" have become commonplace. However, in 1994, this mainstream studio film with a convoluted plot was promoted as an unconventional feel-good summer movie starring Tom Hanks and being directed by Robert Zemeckis, a seasoned hitmaker.\n",

Director David Leitch tends to approach these standoffs the way Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire once did their dance numbers. There's something callous about how casually Leitch takes human life. \"Bullet Train\" is one of the most ambitious pandemic-made blockbusters to be released.\n",

      "It's essentially a live-action cartoon, with high-profile cameos sprinkled in for added laughs. Director David Leitch is trying his darnedest to channel the likes of Tarantino and Ritchie. This may be a fun enough ride, but such punchlines drive home that neither the characters nor the film they inhabit are particularly deep.\n",
      "The Shawshank Redemption is IMDb's top film of all time. Is it just because it is a work of art?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a banker who learns his wife is having an affair and is wrongfully imprisoned for killing both her and the secret lover in the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption, which was based on a short story by Stephen King at a time when moviemakers were clamouring to adapt the author's work. While serving his sentence at Shawshank, Andy learns the ins and outs of prison life and makes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), but beyond his composed exterior is a burning desire to get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though The Shawshank Redemption is now regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, success wasn't an easy thing for the Frank Darabont production. Even though the recent reviews weren't as flattering as the old ones, the movie did well at the box office. The Shawshank Redemption suffered significantly and bombed horribly. Although Andy's quest for independence was acknowledged in that year's Academy Award nominations, he was not successful in winning any gold. The Shawshank Redemption gradually grew in popularity through TV airplay and video rentals, and its reputation started to rise. Eventually, the movie was acknowledged as a genuine classic. Right now, The Shawshank Redemption is dominating IMDb's list of the top 250 movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did The Shawshank Redemption maintain such fervent broad appeal in a field when opinion is always changing? \n",
      "The Shawshank Redemption is, above all else, a brilliant work of art on every level. In addition to Freeman and Robbins' performances, which are among the best ever, Shawshank also features a cast of beautifully realised supporting players that both surprise and captivate in equal measure. The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont and photographed by the renowned Roger Deakins, features stunning vistas despite being mostly set in a less-than-stellar prison setting. The character-driven narrative has a built-in energy that allows viewers to naturally follow Andy and Red's story during the upbeat scenes but grips them with tension during the tough, darker scenes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Greenwashing, sometimes known as 'green sheen,' is a marketing phrase that describes how firms fool consumers into believing that their products and organisational practises are ecologically benign.\n",
      "\n",
      "SKIMS has been accused of this technique because their packaging was seen to be inconsistent with the environmental efforts it professes to make, particularly with relation to plastic.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am compostable, made from plants. I will biodegrade in your home compost and in an industrial compost facility,” it adds. According to Changing Markets Foundation, however, the packaging lists an additional number ‘4’ logo, which contradicts its claims.\n",

      "According to the Changing Markets Foundation, a non-profit organisation with the \"mission to expose irresponsible corporate practises and drive change towards a more sustainable economy,\" the triangular logo — a recycling symbol — within which the number '4' appears indicates that the packaging is made from type-4 plastic, or low-density polyethylene (LDPE).\n",

Reportedly, the number of screens for Laal Singh Chaddha have also been decreased due to declining ticket sales. Aamir's remarks about avoiding a theatrical conflict with this year's greatest blockbuster KGF: Chapter 2, starring Kannada star Yash, have shown to be accurate during the low box office performance put up by Laal Singh Chaddha.

Laal Singh Chaddha' was supposed to release on that day. But fortunately for us, Red Chillies was taking a little time on the VFX so we got saved!

The degrees of  plunging fortunes that Dobaaraa experiences in the course of its two-hour-fifteen-minute running time are epic. The film, alas, is far from epic. The very basis of the time-travel  theme is shaky. A boy witnesses a murder in his neighbour’s home at exactly 2.12 am (hence Do Baaraa, get it?).\n",
      "\n",
      "What follows from there is indescribably tragic in ways that have nothing to do with the characters. So what is  Dobaaraa about? This question may take hours, perhaps days or even weeks and months to answer. For all we know, Dobaaraa may one day, be recognized as one of the great classics of world cinema. But let's not jump –and here comes Kashyap’s favourite instrument of creativity—the  gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future interpretations notwithstanding, Dobaaraa seems to be a monstrous misfire, with  Taapsee Pannu struggling to lend a semblance of credibility to a screenplay that jumps from the era of the VCR to the laptop without humour or  irony. Antara (Pannu) is connected via an old television set with a boy named Anay, who wears Terminator T-shirts and snoops around an adulterous neighbour’s home, whose door is always ajar in spite of the murderous activities inside.\n",
      "\n",

      "My journey as a footballer was as challenging as it was rewarding. I hail from a remote area in NorthEast India and growing up, we had limited opportunities for sports. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was persistent and pursued football because it is my passion. Although my family supported me in pursuing my interests, they were unsure if it was the right choice for a professional career. To settle their concerns, I started working in a 9-5 job, but I knew there was no way I could settle down without making football my career. I started playing for Oil India while I worked for them, and I loved doing what I did. I remember the first goal I scored for Oil India with vivid clarity. Eversince, I haven't looked back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am grateful to the football community including the audience, coaches and teammates I have played with for how encouraging and supportive they are. I draw inspiration from the national and international players I have played with and I have learned so much from them over the past years. After my family saw the overwhelming love I received nationally and internationally, they supported my ambitions. I felt so happy seeing them take pride in my work as a professional footballer.\n",
      "\n",
      "My journey is not without challenges. It's difficult to balance training, work life and personal life as well. Currently, I am working as an accountant general for HDFC Bank. When I'm not in the office, I'm on the field kicking the ball and scoring goals. When I'm not training, I love going for long rides. The surroundings are beautiful and offer breathtaking views. I enjoy watching those sceneries and connecting with nature.\n",

      "I began my professional football debut a long time back and have played in the Indian Super League. I remember the exhilarating feeling I experienced while playing for Oil India against Mohun Bagan in 2009. I scored a goal, and that’s how my professional journey began. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is always thrilling to be on the ground, watching the audience cheer for you and receive love and respect from the people of your country. Playing for the Indian Super League gave me purpose and motivated me to turn my passion into my profession. I went on to play for many other teams after my debut during the Federation Cup in Kolkata in 2009. At that time, I was also working for Oil India, and although it was challenging to balance my work life while pursuing what I love, the journey was rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following few years, I signed my first professional contract with the Churchill Brothers, and this was a huge opportunity because I could focus all my attention and efforts on the game. My journey as a footballer only became more fulfilling as I moved on to different clubs like Mumbai Tigers, Shillong Lajong and NorthEast United. I learned so much from each season I played with the different teams, and it also gave me the opportunity to interact with various national and international footballers.\n",

The funds raised contribute to local developmental causes and sports initiatives. I also guide budding footballers and mentor them to become successful professional players with my work at the association. I love seeing local talent thrive by giving them opportunities to grow in this field. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the association’s charity work also helps me support the families of players who have passed. My duty as a footballer is to honour other players and value the work we do in this profession. It adds purpose to my cause to support those who need it the most. \n",
      "\n",
      "The image of football in this country is not as hyped as other sports like cricket. Every sports field deserves equal recognition and support from the country's people because we all collectively represent our country internationally regardless of the sports we play. I am hopeful for the future of football in India, and I am grateful to those who unconditionally support our profession. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am deeply humbled by the love and support I have received from my fans and the people of my country. I wish to grow more as a person and a football player to continue inspiring young footballers to engage in sports and never give up on their dreams.

United's frontline with Sancho,Fernandes, Eriksen and Ronaldo and Rashford look toothless. As a matter of fact, the first team needed a whole reboot.

      "\n",
      "With the Antony deal looking impossible due to Ajax setting up such high fees for him, United may shift to the Moroccan. The Moroccan was a prized jewel for Erik ten Hag’s side at Ajax. Chelsea would be wary of selling the Moroccan to a possible top 4 side. With Man United facing their first defeat of the season, United would be hurrying up to strengthen other positions. The transfer window closes in 20 days or so. Do you think we will see Ziyech become a Red Devil? Leave your comments\n",

      "\n",
      "The forward who terrorized defenders in the Bundesliga was struggling in the Premier League. He could register a mere 3 goals, scoring at every 643.6 minutes, which was eyebrow raising in itself. He could also register only 3 assists. This season he’ll be looking to justify the price tag which made United go after him.\n",

      "\n",
      "Along with 4 assists, Cunha has scored 6 goals too. He has taken 1.2 shots per game, scoring at every 176 minutes. He was on target 0.5 times per game. All of his 6 goals came inside the box, with one being from left foot, and the other 5 with right.\n",
      "Man United's search for a forward is well known. The forwards in their ranks in the form of Cristiano Ronaldo, Anthony Martial, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga have been misfiring. Barring Ronaldo everyone has been hit with a misfiring bug. Since the arrival of Erik Ten Hag, he was after Antony of his former club Ajax, but United balked by the asking price of Ajax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However it looks like Man Utd's search for a forward could be coming to a conclusion with Cody Gakpo who plays for PSV Eindhoven and is recently keen to move to Premier League, to join up with Manchester United. The 2-1 loss to Brighton forced the upper hierarchy to jump in pursuit of forwards. Ex- West Ham striker Marko Arnautovic was linked but the idea was dropped after resistance from United fans. Their attention turned on Cody Gakpo who is currently managed by ex United legend Rudd Van Nistelrooy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Arsenal were interested in the Dutchman but nothing came of it. But this time around PSV might be forced to sell him if an offer comes in the region of 35 million. Cody, who primarily plays in the left-wing position and is right footed might face competition from Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sanch, who currently own that berth. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cody’s 12 goals and 12 assists forced teams from far to look out for the youngster. Cody, primarily being a left-winger can also play on the left of a front three and also up front. It’ll be a relief for Ronaldo, who can take turns with him to start for the club.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Seasonal review\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at his seasonal map,we can see that even though he covered the left side of the pitch, it was focused mainly in the attacking third of the pitch. We will see more of his actions as we uncover why United went after him. \n",
      "Passes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cody is a goal scorer as well as someone who likes providing assists. His abilities prompted United to look out for him. He had 12 assists to his name. He had a passing accuracy of 77%,making 18.7 passes per 90.He had 2.6 key passes per 90.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Along with his 12 goals he had 80 shots to his name, out of which 30 were on target. He has taken shots every 3.77 per 90, out of which they were on target 1.42 times per 90. From the visualization we can see that Gakpo falls in the first quadrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a lethal forward, because out of 12 goals he scored, 11 were non penalty goals, and one was from the spot kick. He had spot kick conversion with 100% success rate. We can see that he falls into the first quadrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the 12 goals he scored 11 were inside the box, while 1 was scored outside the box.He had scored every 159 minutes.Even though he missed big 4 chances, he had decent goals to his name.He had a goal conversion of 15%.\n",

However he faltered in assists as he had only 3 assists to his name. While Cody scored 12 goals and he had 12 assists to his name scoring at every 159 minutes. \n",
      "Final Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "United, having missed on Benjamin Sesko, Antony, would be doing anything to get their man.United already has a colorful history with the Eredivisie League, having snapped 13 players from the Dutch League. Some of them were Jaap Stam, Rudd Van Niestelrooy, Park Ji Sung, Alexander Buttner to name a few. United had raided PSV in the past, and with Van Niestelrooy their manager, expected the deal to happen. Will Cody Gakpo be another Red Devil? Watch this space.\n",

      "\n",
      "From the heatmap, we can see that he was deployed mostly on the left. Szobozlai is a modern playmaker, which means with creating attacking opportunities, he is involved in the defensive side of the game. He combined his raw physical prowess, amazing technical ability, and dynamic mentality. Even though he is just 21 years old, it'll take him some time to be a world-class attacking midfielder.\n",

      "Set Pieces Specialist\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his dangerous passes, he is deadly from dead ball situations.

When I used to play in the local league of that time I used to get a lot of awards like the best player. I even got top scorer many a times even though that I used to play as a midfielder.

That's what I wanted to emulate whenever I played on the pitch. A free flowing style of passing and ease, putting emphasis on my technique rather than showboating.\n",

      "Any initiative that works on transforming for the better is not without obstacles or challenges. Running a club is not easy, and the difficulties intensify when one has to deal with young minds still developing.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the founder of the club, Muthok Khongmawloh, maintaining children of different ages is very difficult. Children of varying dispositions require age-appropriate guidance to cater to their requirements. It is also hard for a handful of members to run a whole training centre receiving a massive volume of sports enthusiast youngsters. Running a training centre can’t just be a one-person show. \n",
      "\n",
      "The centre has also extended its activities to farming, trekking, and interactive nature activities, requiring just as much attention as football training. It is not possible for Muthok to solely manage everything because different batches of children need expert guidance at all times while they are training. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody can understand the football game, but only a few can teach it. This holds true for most sports activities. Coaches and expert trainers must be called to guide young children in their developmental stages. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the shortage of coaches in remote areas, trainees also require appropriate sports gear to help them with training. Acute shortages in funding and sponsorships often leave clubs like the Little Star Football Club with difficulties in conducting their operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the challenges Little Star FC faces and measures to tackle them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Funding the club to recruit coaches\n",
      "2) Sponsoring football kits and sports gear\n",
      "3) Sharing and amplifying the Club’s initiative and cause\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Star FC’s inner spirit gives it the strength to continue despite its challenges. The club needs some form of help to continue its operations and expand its outreach to more underprivileged children who often lack access to opportunities and little things that bring us so much joy.\n",
      "Pyrshang Da Lade’s Little Star Football Club was started with the objective of keeping children away from excessive screen time. Muthok Khongmawloh, the club's founder, wanted children to have holistic development where they balanced academics with sports and physical activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The club has transformed many lives and has successfully organised a tournament called the Riwar Cup. The Riwar cup was the largest organised football tournament in the area and was attended by several young players from surrounding regions. It saw 198 children participating in the games and had other camp facilities provided to the players during their stay. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Little Star Football club has won several local games, and the club managers ensure that the village children can attend as many tournaments as possible. Finances become a problem because sponsoring sports kits and travel arrangements are expensive. Hiring coaches to train the village children are an added expense too. However, Muthok’s indomitable spirit has made it possible to run the club for so long. He says the club has a bright future and is grateful for the encouragement and support he received from the village and his elders. He likes to see families in the village happy because their children are getting to live a happy and active childhood with access to opportunities they might not get otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muthok has several plans for the club. He wants to take the children to more tournaments at the national level and have formal practice sessions with expert coaches. He also wants to extend the club activities to more villages, sponsor more kits and guide talented children to become professional players.\n",

      "Sometimes it becomes unfathomable to understand what would be the parent's intent or anyone's intent to choose tough love as a mechanism to help people improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, as the name itself portrays a prominent picture of what it would look like, the harshness, coldness and the imperative behaviour to deal with people.\n",
      "But what does tough love actually mean? \n",
      "\n",
      "Community activist Bill Milliken firstly used the term in 1968. Tough love is \"the promotion of someone's welfare by enforcing constraints or making them take responsibility for their actions; the method of encouraging self-help by restricting the assistance of others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As abusive and emotionally challenging as the term may seem, it is not,  if done, choosing the right pathway which does not harm someone emotionally.\n",
      "Trying to use some healthy methods like parents choosing not to pay their child's bills because they want him to change his adamant behaviour and realise his responsibilities. \n",
      "This could help them learn more about their real-life struggles, eventually turning them into different versions of themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in the old times, people used to believe that tough love could make a person better and help them make their personality strong. So tough love is fine if it doesn't harm, belittle or torture the person.\n",
      "While social relationships are the central source of emotional support for most people, social relationships can be highly stressful. For example, marriage is the most salient source of support and stress for many individuals, and poor marital quality has been associated with compromised immune and endocrine function. In addition, depressionsociological research shows that marital strain erodes physical health and that the negative effect of marital stress on health becomes more significant with advancing age. \n",
      "\n",
      "Relationship stress undermines health through behavioral, psychosocial, and physiological pathways. For example, relationship stress contributes to poor health habits in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Stress contributes to psychological distress and physiological arousal (e.g., increased heart rate and blood pressure) that can damage health through cumulative wear and tear on physiological systems and by leading people of all ages to engage in unhealthy behaviours (e.g., food consumption, heavy drinking, smoking) to cope with stress and reduce unpleasant arousal \n",
      "\n",
      "The propensity to engage in particular risky health behaviours in response to stress appears to vary over the life course. For example, stress is associated with more alcohol consumption in young adulthood and more significant weight gain in mid-life. Relationship stress also undermines a sense of personal control and mental health, both of which are, in turn, associated with poorer physical health.\n",
      "Wine etiquette is an art that is instead learnt over time to master its integrities proficiently. Drinking wine is common in social gatherings or while meeting with friends and sharing quality time with family. These etiquette help an individual to handle oneself with confidence in such groups. The act of consuming wine, though infamously overwhelming, is quite simple and easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "See - To check for colour and clarity, ensure the bowl doesn’t contain any unnecessary residues that may interfere with the overall taste of the beverage. Also, suppose the intensity of the colour is amiss. In that case, it may reflect staleness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swirl - You need to swirl the wine in your glass to increase its contact with the air, releasing its aroma and allowing the vino to blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sniff - You may place your nose just above the wine glass and inhale its aroma to identify the complex notes that seamlessly blend to give the vino its distinctive taste and character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sip - Last but not least, sip, savour and relish your wine!\n",
      "Cognitive behavioural therapy is used to treat a wide range of issues. It's often the preferred type of psychotherapy because it can quickly help you identify and cope with specific challenges. In addition, it generally requires fewer sessions than other types of therapy and is done in a structured way.\n",

Gender is a social construct foisted on people by the world so they can assert and affirm that they're part of only gender identity which society has made for them.\n",
      "As people are becoming more aware of their rights to choose their identity and gender non-conformities, there is still a lack of awareness among parents to promote gender-neutral parenting.\n",

      "Here we are talking about the children who are not born with gender or likings for a pink dress or blue shirt.\n",
      "They are just new beings in the world who need assistance to feel comfortable in whatever way they identify themselves.\n",
      "Here, the parent's role is to protect their children from the potentially detrimental influence of the gender binary.\n",
      "I mean, for a boy to choose from cars, action toys and superman, while on the other hand, it is kitchen sets, princess costumes or dolls are given as options for girls.\n",
      "Already stigmatising and dividing what a child should be like without even letting them understand their identity and if it is acceptable to like a girl's toys or stuff even if he is a boy is not OK.\n",
      "It makes children feel excluded and ashamed of what they want to choose to be. Instead, parents should be responsible for creating a free space for their children in their early parenting years.\n",
      "So that they don't feel limited while choosing what they like and don't feel burdened by their roles in society.\n",

      "There are different writing therapies which you should learn about.\n",
      "Most of them are divided into two categories, one when the writing therapy is conducted with the guidance of a mental health counsellor, and the other is self-motivated writing therapy, the latter of which anyone can take up at their own pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "A counsellor or mental health professional might use writing therapy with clients who find it difficult to verbalize their thoughts or emotions. Narrative therapy, a form of writing therapy that clients and therapists can use together, is often helpful in this situation. Narrative therapy involves the client and mental health professional \"reauthoring\" a traumatic or problematic story from the client's life.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another standard format, which can be practised with or without the guidance of a mental health professional, is called interactive journaling. It combines aspects of writing therapy and bibliotherapy. In interactive journaling, clients are provided with a journal prompt or a starting point, which they then use to inform their writing. This method is especially effective in substance abuse treatment because it can educate patients and promote reflection and exploration of their experiences. It can also benefit students in the health care field because it can help them empathize with and understand their clients' experiences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two other types of writing therapy are focused writing and songwriting. Focused writing incorporates worksheets that educate and guide clients, and songwriting combines music therapy and writing therapy to provide clients with an avenue to reminisce and express their emotions.\n",
      "Of course not; the range and types of therapy differ from one another.\n",
      "It depends on what and how you choose to seek help.\n",
      "Most commonly, it is divided into these four to five categories, which involve different techniques and ways of dealing with the person's problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of its types is behavioural therapy; as the name suggests, this therapy is mainly used to help people change their malignant behaviour, often termed self-destructive or unhealthy. Behavioural therapy often uses classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning to help clients alter problematic behaviours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model, which states that thoughts, feelings and behaviour are all connected and that individuals can move toward overcoming difficulties and meeting their goals by identifying and changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking, problematic behaviour, and distressing emotional responses. It works by replacing negative thoughts with positive and more realistic ones. It works on changing the beliefs of the person.\n",
      "\n",
      "CBT( cognitive behavioural therapy) is another umbrella term that follows different tricks and techniques to deal with the person.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also heard about the psychoanalytic approach developed by Sigmund Freud; it was Freud's way of delving into a person's thoughts and past experiences to help the person by analysing them.\n",
      "Four elements explain the occurrence of negativity bias; Paul Rozin and Edward Poyzman explained this.\n",
      "The four elements are negative potency, steeper negative gradients, negativity dominance and negative differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negative potency describes the idea that though negative and positive events or memories may be equal in magnitude or emotionality, they are not necessarily equally salient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another one is a steeper negative gradient; an upcoming dental surgery's negative experience is regarded as more and more negative as the date of the appointment approaches, meaning there is a steep negative gradient. \"Rozin and Royzman found that adverse events are perceived as increasingly hostile and thus have a more vertical angle than positive events are. Positive developments then have a flatter gradient in comparison to adverse events.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Negativity dominance describes the tendency for the combination of positive and negative items/events/etc. to skew towards an overall more negative interpretation than would be suggested by the summation of the individual positive and negative components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negative differentiation is consistent with evidence suggesting that the conceptualization of negativity is more elaborate and complex than that of positivity. For instance, research indicates that negative vocabulary is more richly descriptive of the affective experience than that positive vocabulary.\n",
      "There's a huge gap between the teacher's and parent's relationship.\n",
      "Parents need to understand that they can't have unrealistic expectations from their child's tutor.\n",
      "It is not someone who will listen to their mean comments or judgements just because they're paying the schools for their child's education.\n",
      "\n",
      "There should be an understanding that whatever a teacher would do, it would be for the child's interest, and that's what teachers care about the most; otherwise, why would they be teaching?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, it's not an easy path out there. A teacher's life is not confined to educating your kids; they have got more to do.\n",
      "Their work is as important as that of any other professionals who don't just work hard during their work time but even after it.\n",
      "And this really needs to be discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saddling the teacher with all your child's responsibilities and then saying mean things to them would not be just disrespecting the pressure they take to teach your child, but it is also unacceptable because they don't deserve it.\n",
      "Despite the existing policies, rhetoric and sentiment, teachers are doing their best to provide your kids with a healthy education and environment.\n",

It&#8217;s pretty much the text itself and in a litany of the other things the candidate is supporting.

      "Stream of consciousness is a narrative style that tries to capture a character’s thought process realistically. It’s an interior monologue, but it’s also more than that. Because it mimics the non-linear way our brains work, stream-of-consciousness narration includes much free association, looping repetitions, sensory observations, and strange (or even nonexistent) punctuation and syntax—all of which help us better understand a character’s psychological state and worldview. It’s meant to feel like you have dipped into the stream of the character’s consciousness—or like you’re a fly on the wall of their mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "The term was first used by the psychologist William James in The Principles of Psychology (1890). As the psychological novel developed in the 20th century, some writers attempted to capture the total flow of their characters’ consciousness rather than limit themselves to rational thoughts. To represent the full richness, speed, and subtlety of the mind at work, the writer incorporates snatches of incoherent thought, ungrammatical constructions, and free association of ideas, images, and words at the pre-speech level.\n",

      "\n",
      "After the emotional danger has passed, there is usually a sense of guilt and remorse after realising too much food has been eaten. But unfortunately, this guilt also can lead to more emotional eating outbursts or low self-esteem, resulting in a vicious circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who tend to eat when stressed or anxious are comforted by the feeling in their stomach that masks their emotions.

      "1. It Gives People Hope About Their Condition\n",
      "The nature of mental health conditions means sufferers often feel pessimistic about their future. It can be hard to think ahead to when your illness will no longer impact you. CBT changes this — giving people hope. It does this by helping people see that our thoughts are not always accurate. They do not always represent what’s likely to happen in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It Helps People Develop Self-Esteem\n",
      "Many mental health conditions are associated with low self-esteem.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It Can Help People Relax\n",
      "The behavioural aspect of CBT helps us learn to control how we respond to our symptoms. A lot of the time, this involves developing calmer responses using various relaxation techniques. This allows us to regulate our responses to triggers and reduce symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It Develops More Rational Thought Processes\n",
      "The main benefit of CBT is that it helps us gain control of our thoughts.\n",
      "Cognitive distortions are common and often happen automatically, without question. However, questioning and replacing negative thoughts can transform our thought processes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "You no longer allow negative thoughts to take control but can reason and evaluate the appropriate response to difficult situations.\n",

      "\n",
      "For the past two years, covid created much chaos, and no one was left out of its trap; it was a difficult timeline for teachers who had to change their teaching ways and then endure the hostilities of both the parents and children.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we see two sides of this narrative, one where the children lie and the other hand where the parents lie, there is a deep connection.\n",
      "Earlier it was the parents who used to teach their children the importance of respecting their tutors. Fortunately, even the child knew about the decorum and considered their teachers as idols.\n",
      "But the whole outlook has turned into vitriol where parents are most often seen talking about teachers in a deplorable manner which eventually impacts their children's minds, and they develop this unlikeliness for their teachers.\n",

      "Children begin to identify the basic gender differences at just a tender age of three. From the time they're born, they're compelled to abide by some gender-specific performance which makes them believe what they're doing even if they would be unwilling to do so later in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children are often scolded if they choose to do things that don't conform to the social rule of gender identity; this evokes confusion about their true identity, which can affect them in future.\n",

      "There is affective empathy, an ability to share the emotions of others; here, the feelings and reactions are deep-rooted and visceral. \n",
      "While on the other hand, cognitive empathy is an ability to understand the emotions of others, but that shouldn't be necessarily visceral like a psychologist who understands the clients' emotions rationally.\n",
      "Lastly, there is emotional regulation, an ability to understand empathy but to regulate one's emotions.\n",
      "Empathy basically makes us aware of our emotions, and instead, it is essential because it helps us understand how others are feeling so we can respond appropriately to the situation. It is typically associated with social behaviour, and much research shows that greater empathy leads to more helping behaviour.\n",

      "<p dir=\"ltr\">Atkins introduced four phases in his diet: induction, ongoing weight loss, pre-maintenance and lifetime maintenance.</p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The first phase is an induction phase; in this phase, you can cut out almost all carbohydrates from your diet. <br>\n",
      "Although 20gms or carbs can be taken, the rest is taken through different foods added to this diet.<br>\n",
      "In this phase, you eat protein, such as fish and shellfish, poultry, meat, eggs, and cheese, at every meal. As a result, you don't need to limit oils and fats. </p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">In phase 2, a person adds 20&#8211;25 g of carbs per day during the first week,<br>\n",
      "30 g of carbs during the second week, 30 g each subsequent week until weight loss slows to 1&#8211;2 pounds a week.</p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The aim of phase 2 is to find out how many carbs an individual can eat while continuing to lose weight. This phase continues until the individual is within 5&#8211;10 pounds of their target weight.</p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">The third phase is pre-maintenance. In this phase, you slowly keep increasing the range of foods you can eat, including fruits, starchy vegetables and whole grains. You can add about 10 grams of carbs to your diet each week. But you must cut back if your weight loss stops. You stay in this phase until you reach your goal weight.<br>\n",
      "Lastly, there is lifetime maintenance. You move into this phase when you reach your goal weight. Then you keep on with this way of eating for life. <br><br><br><br><br></p>\n",
      "Social isolation is a complete or near-complete lack of contact between an individual and society. It differs from loneliness, reflecting a temporary and involuntary lack of communication with other humans. Social isolation can be an issue for individuals of any age, though symptoms may differ by age group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social isolation has similar characteristics in both temporary instances and for those with a historical lifelong isolation cycle. All types of social isolation can include staying home for lengthy periods, having no communication with family, acquaintances or friends, and avoiding contact with other humans when those opportunities arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "True social isolation over the years and decades can be a chronic condition affecting all aspects of a person's existence. For example, social isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem.\n",
      "It is not that hard to identify why talk therapy would help anyone.\n",
      "Most of us, whenever in distress, feel that yearning for someone in our life with whom we can share everything that is bothering us.\n",
      "Well, for that, one does not need to seek professional therapy; it could be someone very dear to you who would always lend an ear to your problems.\n",
      "But talk therapy helps; it really does.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important reason is that it sometimes works as a catharsis; you want to put all your emotions out by telling it to someone.\n",
      "Even in professional therapies, it helps because repressed emotions would always come to haunt you. So it's better to throw it all out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most serious drawback of not talking about things may be that unexpressed feelings and traumas can pile up and explode later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of us feel that repressing or pressing down our feelings would not let them hinder our life.\n",
      "But that's not true. It would instead be exploded whenever something awful would remind you of what you have been avoiding or hiding. \n",
      "\n",
      "So it is essential to let it all out by speaking to someone; it could be your therapist or a close friend.\n",
      "Someone who can do, create and think ahead of their time is never forgotten, and so was Princess Diana, the princess of Wales.\n",
      "Her stories are still narrated, talked about and never fail to cheer up people.\n",
      "Diana's power made her a role model for every woman even after 25 years of her death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her life was an amalgamation of all goods and melancholy, but she overpowered everything with her will and heart.\n",
      "She was everything that didn't represent the aristocratic nature from where she belonged. Her life story helped people relate to her even now or then.\n",
      "Besides her bold and stylish appearance, what people liked the most was her caring and compassionate nature. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite her failed marriage, she continued to work as an epitome of a perfect woman.\n",
      "Her vulnerability, disappointment and the way to come out of the morass are all captured and kept carefully in the eyes of the public.\n",
      "As the world calls it, she was people's princess. In 1987 she was famously seen shaking an Aids patient’s hand without wearing gloves, sending a message to the terrifying world that the disease could not be transmitted by touch.\n",
      "Her exuberance and aura are taken forward by her sons, William and Harry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana broke stereotypes and spoke her mind even at times when breaking a royal protocol would be a sin. She was also among the first royals \"to speak about her mental health struggles, which she did in her now-infamous 1995 BBC Panorama interview with Martin Bashir, where she admitted to suffering from depression and bulimia.\" \n",
      "She did much as a woman, mother, wife and more than everything as a human being.\n",
      "History knows many women who made themselves role models; Diana will remain one of them.\n",
      "Many of us have this penchant for reading books as there are different ways how books heal you. However, not everyone is a reading fan but still likes stories and books.\n",

      "The urge to always focus on something negative can make your brain feel exhausted and always inclined towards the same kind of thoughts. This can eventually lead to mental health problems making is difficult to deal with any situation as you have this knack for seeing darkness even if the light is abundant.\n",
      "But this needs to be resolved to build a positive outlook on life and other things around you.\n",
      "\n",
      "We often hear about self-help and that no one can help us until we take little steps. Undoubtedly, this is true. However, how we perceive things, what we learn from our surroundings and how we prepare ourselves for a situation depends on us.\n",
      "So we need to look more into the thoughts that run in our minds and avoid negative self-talk to aggravate them.\n",
      "If you stop your negative thoughts whenever they begin, it will help you fight the negativity bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you ruminate on things, look for an uplifting activity to pull yourself out of this negative mindset. If you find yourself mentally reviewing some unpleasant event or outcome, consciously try to redirect your attention elsewhere and engage in an activity that brings you joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, be grateful and give more importance to every little happiness that comes to you. Though negative emotions are quickly stored in our brains, if efforts are put to get the same effect as positive ones, things will change.\n",
      "If a lot of it has changed, it wouldn't always be one side of the story to narrate. However, I think some past instances and occurrences have brought this cruelty to parents' behaviour.\n",
      "When I speak of parents here, it's not about every parent; of course, it's not about every teacher either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blaming it all on parents would not be the right thing to do. I mean, yes, some parents don't appreciate their child's teacher at all; they would say mean things and even disrespect their efforts, but what about the teachers who don't pay attention to the child's growth at all?\n",
      "If we are discussing the teacher-parent relationships and what \"only\" teachers have to endure, then discussing classroom behaviour is equally important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always complaining about the child's behaviour and demotivating them in front of the class is as inappropriate as the parent's way of dealing with some good teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the tutor's role in a classroom to not make some children feel marginalized, but since there are the ones who have done it, this has made parents question the teacher in certain unacceptable ways.\n",
      "It could be mean and impertinent but what they care about is their children because half of the time child spends in school, and that's where they can adapt good or bad from the environment.\n",
      "So if we are arguing over parents' behaviour, then teachers' behaviour should also be paid attention to.\n",
      "There should be a way in which parents can choose the techniques to talk to their kids about gender in an age-appropriate manner.\n",
      "So how would parents teach a child who is not that smart enough to understand their gender roles?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many ways, like choosing books as a medium to make them learn; a book that offers characters that don't conform to gender norms. Children would understand and create role models that would motivate them to expand their imagination and choose diverse ways to express themselves.\n",
      "Different books are available that question gender conformities by affirming that any identity is accepted and appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than this, it could be parents themselves who can build a gender-neutral surrounding, like teaching their children through small things when they're choosing to buy a toy or anything that is gender specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, it could be done by not scolding or limiting them if they choose something against the gender rules.\n",
      "It is the duty of parents to encourage their kids in every way possible to make them feel liberated and comfortable.\n",
      "Well, it isn't easy to feel positive if all the negativity encompasses you but what if you try to change those negative emotions into positive ones?\n",
      "\n",
      "You reached your office late and didn't eat anything for the whole day, it seemed like the worst day, but still, you carried a smile to tackle all the challenges that came your way and surprisingly, it helped. Making every effort to focus on the situation's positive side can improve it.\n",
      "You would give your brain a place to breathe, so try it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-talk is the best way towards self-awareness and knowing yourself.\n",
      "So what you talk to yourself about is essential. When we talk badly about ourselves, we start to believe what we are saying, perpetuating bad feelings. When you start saying things like, \"I am a terrible person,\" change that line into something like \"I am a great person!\" your brain will process what you said and react accordingly within a few seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surroundings can torment you or help you feel happier, so it's upon us who and what we keep in our surroundings.\n",
      "Keeping ourselves around people with positive energy would bring a good vibe. Similarly, clean and better surroundings would keep the brain calm and at ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another step toward building positive thinking is to be grateful.\n",
      "We often forget to accept and acknowledge what we have, but doing it could bring significant change. Even if all seems to be falling apart, take a moment to appreciate people and things in your life. You'll see how accessible your brain would feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accepting and processing negative thoughts or emoticons can be difficult, especially when the situation inflicts you. Still, life could be easier if we begin to take it as a part of our journey.\n",

      "<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many side effects associated with the diet. Some very low-carb diets also restrict carbs so much that they cause you not to have enough nutrients or fibre. This can cause such health problems as constipation, diarrhoea and nausea.

      "<p dir=\"ltr\">It's also possible that restricting carbohydrates to less than 20 grams a day &#8212; the level recommended for phase 1 of the diet &#8212; can result in ketosis. Ketosis occurs when you don't have enough carbohydrates broken down into sugar (glucose) for energy, so your body breaks down stored fat. This causes ketones to build up in your body. Side effects from ketosis can include nausea, headache, mental fatigue and bad breath.</p>\n",

For example, the Atkins Diet recommends that you talk to your health care provider before starting the diet if you take diuretics, insulin or oral diabetes medications.

However, with the growth of the modern cosmetic and wellness industries, these deceptively simple substances have often been overlooked. Still, they've had a bit of a resurgence in the public eye over the last decade, as people strive to find additive-free, affordable, and effective products.\"\n",

      "These oils are:\n",
      "Olive oil\n",
      "It is an excellent choice for an all-body application. You may even want to try an olive oil cleanser or bar of soap for a clean that won't dry out your skin.\n",

      "Sunflower Seed Oil\n",
      "Sunflower seed oil is widely available, high in vitamin E, and absorbs quickly into the skin, making it an excellent choice as a natural moisturizer.\n",

      "Shea Butter\n",
      "Derived from the nuts of the African shea tree, shea butter is a tallow-like substance commonly found in a solid form, but it melts at body temperature and is sometimes used as a moisturizer and hair product.\n",

      "\n",
      "If nonfacial skin is dehydrated, you might want to use a thicker moisturizer (Eucerin, Cetaphil, others) or an oil, such as baby oil. Fat has more staying power than lotions and prevents the evaporation of water from the skin's surface. \n",

      "<p dir=\"ltr\">With just 11 days left for the transfer window to end, Cristiano Ronaldo is still a player at Manchester United. The Portuguese international has made his feelings clear about leaving the club in the summer. However, Ronaldo is still to get a clear a cut offer from a UCL club as of today. Ronaldo had been linked with multiple teams including Atletico Madrid over the last few days. However, things have not been finalized between any teams and the player. But, the Lastest news now suggests that the Portuguese striker could eventually end up moving back to Spain, this time with Atletico Madrid. The Spanish club has reportedly already made calculations and have had a chance to talk with Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo's agent. Atletico Madrid fans have already made their feelings clear about the potential Ronaldo transfer. The Los Rojiblancos faithful do not want the striker owing to his years with Real Madrid. Moving to Atletico would tarnish CR7's legacy with Real Madrid as well. Ronaldo especially wants to move out of Manchester United as the team is significantly struggling in the PL. To add to this, the striker also wants to play in the UCL and has hence requested an immediate transfer out of Man United. With Sporting Lisbon and Borussia Dortmund also being included as possible options, it has to be seen what is to happen in the next few days with respect to Ronaldo's future.</p>\n",
      "Former Real Madrid star and current PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas could be headed to the Serie A this season. Napoli are reportedly interested in the services of the Costa Rican and have hence set their sights on the star! \n",
      "\n",
      "Keylor Navas has not been very happy since the signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma last season. The PSG star was forced to share his duties with the Italian keeper last season and some reports stated he was not happy with the situation. Moving forward to the 22/23 season, the new Paris Saint Germain manager Christophe Galtier publicly announced that Gianluigi Donnarumma will be the starter ahead of Navas. Hence this has made the goalie think twice regarding a move. \n",
      "\n",
      "Serie A giants Napoli have since been in touch with the goalie as they look to sign a new number 1! Chelsea's Kepa Arizzabalaga has also been in talks for the role but as per the recent reports, the Naples-based side prefer signing the Costa Rican! \n",
      "\n",
      "As per CBS Sports’ Ben Jacobs,  the expectation is that Keylor Navas will be joining Napoli. Furthermore, Jacobs says Napoli is dropping its interest in Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the World Cup just a few months away, Keylor Navas wants regular playing time as he wants to steer his Costa Rica side out of the group stage and beyond later this year!\n",
      "Arsenal were primed to finish in the top four last season. But a horrible run of results to end the campaign helped Tottenham Hotspur to overtake them as the Gunners had to settle for the 5th spot at the end of a positive season. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Gunners failed to return to the Champions League, Owner Stan Kroenke has heavily invested in the transfer window. The North London club signed on Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira, Gabriel Jesus, and 19-year-old Marquinhos in the summer. But it does look like Arsenal have failed to sign a proper CM even though they were linked with multiple candidates since January. \n",
      "\n",
      "With Leno, Tavarez, and Lacazette gone, the Gunners seem to have replaced their departed superstars quite well. One of the biggest positives for Arsenal would be the fact that Martin Odegaard has been given the captain's armband. The Gunners have had a lot of controversial figures become the captain in the last few seasons. Hence the Norwegian youngster was a great choice as he is very mature for his age. \n",
      "\n",
      "A top-four finish for the Gunners would be important to keep a hold of their young squad. However, winning the Europa League could be the best route to reach the Champions League next season as Mikel Arteta's side would surely enter the competition as one of the favourites this term.\n",
      "Timo Werner has completed his return to RB Leipzig. The German international departs from Chelsea after spending just two seasons at the club. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Blues bought Timo Werner from RB Leipzig for £45m in 2020. But things did not go as well as expected for the German international with the English giants. Werner scored 23 goals in 89 appearances for the Blues and helped them win the UEFA Champions League among other trophies. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the striker was heavily criticized for missing easy opportunities regularly. Due to his varying form, Thomas Tuchel also signed Romelu Lukaku to the club last summer but things did not go as planned with the Belgian international as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "After returning to Leipzig, Werner talked about his objectives with the club. The striker said, \"It was a great time from 2016 to 2020 in which we caused a sensation as a league newcomer. It was a worthy farewell for me back then, going as a record goalscorer. But that's also a bit of the past and now I'm looking ahead, because RB Leipzig has developed over the past two years, just like I have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the 2022 FIFA World Cup set to take place in Qatar in November, Timo Werner would certainly want to rediscover his touch. It has to be seen if the German can cement his position in the Leipzig starting XI in the coming days.\n",
      "Chelsea FC were crowned the European Champions in 2020/21. But with Roman Abramovich forced to vacate his position and Todd Boehly taking up the mantle, things have been a bit rocky for the Blues since then\n",
      "\n",
      "Thomas Tuchel has seen Rudiger, Lukaku and Christensen leave the club this summer. The Blues have replaced them with big money signungs of Koulibaly and Sterling. But a majority of the Chelsea transfer targets have slipped from their grasp. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thomas Tuchel's team was linked with the likes of Lewandowksi, Raphinha, Kounde, and De Ligt over the transfer window. But Chelsea have failed to convince these players as they chose to sign with other clubs. Ronaldo and Neymar were also linked with the London-based club briefly. But nothing eventually came into place for the Blues. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the new season upon us, Chelsea would be starting off fresh under Todd Boehly. With Werner stated to leave, the attacking mantle would fall on Kai Havertz and Raheem Sterling. Though both the players are more than capable of scoring goals, the Blues could have problems in this department in case of injuries. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Roman Abramovich era will always be etched in the memory of Chelsea fans. With Pundits and Fans not predicting a top four finish for the Blues, it has to be seen if Tuchel's men can prove them wrong when their season kicks off against Everton on Saturday.\n",
      "Timo Werner could be on his way out of Chelsea Football Club this summer. The German international is reportedly ready to take a 50 percent pay cut in his salary as he pushes for a move to Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig in the transfer window. \n",
      "\n",
      "As per Metro Sport, RB Leipzig are now working on an agreement with Chelsea and are exploring the possibility of signing Werner on an initial loan deal with an option to buy. Timo Werner is certainly no stranger to the Bulls as he plied his trade with Leipzig before moving to Chelsea in 2020 on a £47.5 million deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Werner’s current deal is worth around £275,000 a week but as per the report, the striker has accepted a 50 percent pay cut in order to join RB Leipzig. The German club's player Yussuf Poulsen also answered the media regarding the rumour. \n",
      "\n",
      "Poulsen said, \"I hope Werner is coming back, he is a good player. We are a team that is trying to take the next step and develop into one of the biggest clubs in Europe, you need quality players for that. We formed a good partnership in the past.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "With Juventus also being interested, it has to be seen where Werner would be plying his trade next season.\n",
      "It is certainly not a good time to be a Manchester United supporter as the Red Devils are in \"unknown territory\". Everything could eventually boil down to Cristiano Ronaldo as the icon could still depart, taking away even more positivity from the once great club! \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Cristiano Ronaldo is still a Manchester United player but the rumour mill is still churning. It is quite evident that the Portuguese talisman wants to play in the UEFA Champions Lague. Hence with 25+ days remaining in the transfer window, a lot can change within the club. \n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester United have made the signings of Lisandro Martinez, Christian Eriksen, and Tyrell Malacia. But the Red Devils have still not dealt with the problem that they have in defensive midfield. Yes, Fred and McTominay are expected to take the mantle once again. But United suffered badly last season, especially in their midfield. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anthony Martial and Donny Van De Beek are back in the squad after their loan spells. Hence Erik Ten Hag would certainly be in the spotlight when it comes to team selections. With Frenkie De Jong being rumoured to join, the Red Devils could add much-needed steel to their squad. But Ten Hag is still unproven outside the Eredivisie. Hence it would have to be seen if he can guide the Red Devils to a top-four finish this time around.\n",
      "Manchester United legend and current DC United coach Wayne Rooney has had his say on the Ronaldo transfer saga. The Englishman wants the Red Devils to let the Portuguese superstar leave as he wants Ten Hag to establish a clear playing style! \n",
      "\n",
      "As per the Times of India, Wayne Rooney said, \"I think United should let Cristiano Ronaldo go. It's not that Ronaldo can't play in a Ten Hag team. He can play in any team. Ronny will always score you goals. But my personal view is that United aren't ready to challenge for the title now, so the aim has to be to build a team that can win the league in the next three to four years, and you have to plan for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo started on the bench vs Brighton on Sunday. The Portuguese superstar did come on, but he could not have a say in the game as the Red Devils lost 2-1 to the Seagulls on Matchday 1 of the 2022/23 Premier League season. \n",
      "\n",
      "The loss was not received well by the United fans and the Old Trafford stadium was drowned in a chorus of boos at the full-time whistle. Manchester United next face Brentford on 13th August and it has to be seen if they can turn their fortunes around when they travel for the away game next Saturday.\n",
      "Barcelona made headlines in the summer after they completed the signing of Robert Lewandowksi from Bayern Munich. However, the Spanish giants' proposal to register the player has been turned down by LaLiga. \n",
      "\n",
      "SB Nation reports, La Liga has informed FC Barcelona that their five new signings this summer — including Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich — still cannot be registered as the club do not meet financial requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has happened due to the insufficient funds at the club currently. Hence to register the players before 31st August, the Blaugrana would have to make space on their salary bill. For this, it is expected that the club would sell quite a few players. \n",
      "\n",
      "The likes of Frenkie de Jong, Memphis Depay, Martin Braithwaite, Samuel Umtiti, and Miralem Pjanić are all on the transfer list and it is expected that they would be leaving in the summer. Hence with the recent disapproval by LaLiga, Barcelona could fastrack their efforts of selling these players. \n",
      "\n",
      "As per SB Nation, there is no room for a single one of the club’s five new signings: Robert Lewandowski, Joules Koundé, Franck Kessié, Andreas Christensen, and Raphinha; nor two existing players who count as new signings because of when they were extended: Ousmane Dembélé and Sergi Roberto.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FC Barcelona executives have been “holding regular meetings with La Liga for weeks to assess the situation,” and president Joan Laporta has all along maintained that they have done the necessary work to clear the way for the new arrivals. Hence it has to be seen if the Blaugrana can cover all their bases before the end of this month.\n",
      "Liverpool are easily one of the favourites to win the 2022/23 Premier League title before the season starts. But would Sadio Mane's departure affect the team as the Senegalese was the perfect partner in crime to Mohamed Salah! \n",
      "\n",
      "The Reds will begin their Premier League campaign against Fulham on Saturday. Darwin Nunez was the only high-profile signing for Jurgen Klopp's side as the gaffer wanted to maintain the core of his squad. However, Liverpool lost out on matchwinners like Divock Origi and Sadio Mane and Nunez would have to quickly fill these shoes. \n",
      "\n",
      "As stated earlier, Mane was Salah's perfect partner in crime. The Senegalese international scored double-digit goals every season for the Reds in his time at the club. Liverpool do have Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota to fill the left wing, hence the transition should not be as difficult as it seems. \n",
      "\n",
      "Liverpool's biggest positive would be their unchanged defence and midfield. The Reds have already had a positive start to the 2022/23 season by winning the Community Shield title over their rivals Manchester City but the Sky Blues usually go on a long unbeaten run in the league. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hence it is crucial that Liverpool have a good start and have a healthy advantage over Manchester City in the first half of the season if they are to conquer England once again!\n",
      "Yes, the Premier League is back with a bang and we already have a few talking points from Game Week 1 itself. Here are the 3 major talking points from the weekend:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Tottenham Hotspur are potent! \n",
      "\n",
      "The Spurs beat Southampton 4-1 at home to kick off their campaign with a bang! Kulusevski stole the show as Antonio Conte's game plan worked out to perfection. Up next the Whites face Chelsea, this game could give a better picture of what the team is made of! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Erling Haaland shines on his PL debut! \n",
      "\n",
      "Haaland's PL debut was heavily anticipated and the Norwegian #9 showed that he is here to stay. A penalty and a slick finish were enough to get the former Dortmund player his brace as Manchester City beat West Ham 2-0. Can Haaland end up as the top scorer this season? It has to be seen! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Manchester United, Liverpool Drop Points!\n",
      "\n",
      "Liverpool drew 2-2 against newly promoted Fulham as Manchester United lost 2-1 to Brighton at the Old Trafford Stadium. There were bright spots for the Reds as Darwin Nunez starred in the game. But United on the other hand would have to improve a lot if they are to finish in the top four this season under Ten Hag!\n",
      "Lionel Messi announced his return to club football with a delicious double that included a magnificent bicycle kick. The Argentine was the star of the show as Paris Saint Germain began their Ligue 1 title defence with a 5-0 win over Clermont Foot. \n",
      "\n",
      "The away side were without the services of French sensation Kylian Mbappe. However, this did not stop PSG from dominating the stats as they had thrice the number of shots as Clermont. \n",
      "\n",
      "Neymar opened the scoring in the 9th minute courtesy of a Lionel Messi assist. The Brazilian then provided key assists to  Hakimi, Marquinhos, and Messi as he recorded a goal and 3 assists in the first game of the season. \n",
      "\n",
      "Having already dismantled Clermont's hopes, PSG were not done with a 4-0 scoreline. A searching pass from Leandro Parades found Lionel Messi's run into the box. The PSG #30 first controlled the ball with his chest before unleashing a magical overhead kick to award PSG a crucial 5-0 away win. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lionel Messi and Neymar's performances would certainly boost the team's confidence as both the players underperformed in the last season. With Kylian Mbappe set to return from his injury soon, things can only improve for PSG in the 2022/23 season from here on.\n",
      "The 2022/23 LaLiga season is set to kick off on Friday (12th August 22) as Osasuna and Sevilla would play the opening game. As excitement builds to the leadup, let's have a look at who could clinch the title this season! \n",
      "\n",
      "Real Madrid won their 35th LaLiga crown last season and would certainly go in once again as the favourites. However, Los Blancos would face tougher competition this season from Barcelona as the rejuvenated Catalan club has made multiple high-profile signings in the summer. The goalscoring rivalry between Benzema and Lewandowski would be another stand-out in the LaLiga this term. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the El Clasico rivals, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla would be the other two teams that can have a say in the crown. Sevilla have added Isco and Alex Telles to their squad this season whereas Axel Witsel is the biggest name to join Atleti in the transfer window. Hence the above-mentioned teams should finish in the top four! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Predictions: Who would win the title? \n",
      "\n",
      "Though there is renewed excitement, uncertainty still prevails in the Barcelona setup. The club is having trouble in registering the new players and hence could have a problem in the initial few matchdays. Real Madrid on the other hand look settled and would hence be the favourites to retain their LaLiga title in the 2022/23 season.\n",
      "Manchester City won back to back Premier League titles after winning the 2021/22 PL title over Liverpool on the final day. But would things be a lot tougher for Pep Guardiola's side this time around? \n",
      "\n",
      "The Sky Blues have had a significant revamp in their squad in the transfer window. The likes of Raheem Sterling, Fernandinho, Gabriel Jesus and Zinchenko have left the club exluding Fernandinho, the trio have switched loyalties to City's direct rivals. Out of the mentioned players, Sterling would be the biggest miss for Pep Guardiola. But the Spaniard has new players in his kitty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Julian Alvarez, Erling Haaland, and Kalvin Philips are three major boosts that City have gotten to bolster their squad. Its safe to say that Guardiola would'nt have to play a false nine this term around.  But would these signings be enough? Well the Community Shield loss to Liverpool surely puts a question mark on things. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal have significantly improved their squads. Liverpool too have added Darwin Nunez to replace the outgoing Sadio Mane. Hence the initial days of the league could be very crucial to City. There is no doubt that the Sky Blues will hit their stride mid season. But Pep Guardiola would need to be vary of threat the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur could pose in their title defence this season.\n",
      "The 2022/23 Premier League season is set to kick off on 5th August as Crystal Palace welcome Arsenal to Selhurst Park. Here is my prediction of how the 2022/23 season is going to pan out: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Champions: Manchester City \n",
      "\n",
      "The Cityzens have added a much-needed centre forward in Erling Haaland to their ranks. With a sturdy defence and a sharpened attack, the Sky Blues would certainly be the favourites to win the title again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Man City, Liverpool, and the Spurs look set to occupy thr top four berths. All the mentioned clubs have a strong set of players equally partnered by exquisite managers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Man United, Chelsea, and Arsenal would contest for the remaining spots and the Red Devils could slightly pip their opponents in Cristiano Ronaldo decides to stay at the club. \n",

      "\n",
      "Wildcards: Tottenham Hotspur \n",
      "\n",
      "Antonio Conte has gone on a signing spree in the summer signing the likes of Richarlison, Perisic, Spence, Lenglet, and others. The Spurs certainly can upset the big boys on their day but can they go all out and win the league? Only time will tell...\n",

      "\n",
      "Relegation: Nottingham Forest, Fulham, Bournemouth\n",
      "\n",
      "The three clubs that were promoted would certainly have to play out of their skins to stay in the Premier League.  The rest of the clubs look settled hence these 3 could face the drop in May 2023.\n",
      "Real Madrid star Casemiro has completed his move to Manchester United after a successful spell in Spain. However, El Nacional has stated that there is a specific reason why the Brazilian left the Spanish giants! \n",
      "\n",
      "As per the Spanish publication, Casemiro was not happy that Real Madrid signed Aurelien Tchouameni in the summer. Madrid's manager Carlo Ancelotti wanted the French midfielder as he wanted to strengthen the club's midfield ahead of the 22/23 season. The reason behind this was the fact that Ancelotti wanted younger blood at the helm as the legendary trio of Modric-Kroos-Casemiro are all over 30 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "As per the report, Casemiro opted to leave the club due to a sense of betrayal by Madrid’s dealings in the transfer market. The Brazilian is reportedly upset that Los Blancos sanctioned a €100 million move for French buddying midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. Casemiro was reportedly concerned that his place in the middle of the park might be in jeopardy due to the youngster's presence in the Real Madrid squad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester United would certainly benefit from having someone of Casemiro's calibre in their midfield. With Eriksen and Bruno present to assist him, it has to be seen if the Brazilian can bring forth a new era at Old Trafford.\n",
      "Former PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino was relieved from his position last month. The Argentine has since spoken for the first time publicly and he has claimed that the Parisians are obsessed with winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the club's history! \n",
      "\n",
      "As per Marca, Mauricio Pochettino said, \"Everything at PSG is focused on the Champions League and sometimes that can be a little distracting. Those demands seem to only exist in the build-up to European games and other competitions are taken for granted due to PSG's superiority. The Champions League is the obsession and anything short of winning the Champions League is equivalent to failure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This statement holds true as Paris Saint Germain's exit at the hands of Real Madrid last season led to a massive outburst by PSG president Al Khelaiffi. The president supposedly was seen furiously arguing with the referee following the loss to Los Blancos in the round of 16 of the Champions League. \n",
      "\n",
      "PSG have signed Christophe Galtier as their manager for the 2022/23 season after letting go of Pochettino. The Argentine is currently at his home in Barcelona and he would be one of the first names for replacements as big clubs start sacking their managers midway into the upcoming season.\n",
      "Real Madrid are looking to sign a centre-forward in the summer transfer window. Chelsea have reportedly made note of this as they have offered the German international's services to the LaLiga giants. But the Blues have demanded a hefty transfer fee if Los Blancos are to sign the German international in the summer transfer window. \n",
      "\n",
      "As per the Metro, \"The Blues are open to offers for Werner, who has endured a turbulent spell at Stamford Bridge following a £47.5m move from RB Leipzig in 2020. Werner was used primarily as a substitute last season and his prospects for game-time have only worsened following Raheem Sterling’s arrival from Manchester City.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As per the report, Real Madrid have been told that they would have to pay around £30m to secure Timo Werner in the summer transfer window. But with Benzema already in top form, Werner would have to contend with a backup role if he is to move to Real Madrid in the summer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple reports have rather suggested that Timo Werner could be heading back to RB Leipzig instead. The German club has been strongly linked with their former player and with the FIFA World Cup approaching, Werner wants to maximize his game time as he looks to get into the squad for the mega event later this year.\n",
      "Roberto Firmino was reportedly being targetted by Juventus for a potential transfer with rumours also suggesting that the Serie A giants had made an official bid. However, the Brazilian has now clarified that he is in no hurry of leaving Liverpool Football Club. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Liverpool number 9 has stated that he wants to stay at Anfield for the 2022/23 season. Talking to TNT Sports, Roberto Firmino said, “I love this team, this city, and the fans. I'm here. I want to stay of course.\" Hence the Brazilian has put an end to any rumours linking him to other European clubs for now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even though Firmino wants to stay, there is still a question mark hanging over his future. The Brazilian's contract would end in June 2023. Talks of a new contract are yet to start between Firmino and Liverpool. To add to this, the club has Nunez and Jota that could potentially fill Firmino's spot in the long run. Hence the Reds could consider selling him this summer itself in order to salvage some money in transfer fees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp though seems to have other plans. In a recent interview, the German tactician said, \"Bobby (Firmino) is crucial for us, the heart and soul of this team, the way we played in the last years was only possible because of Bobby. That’s why I’m really happy he was able to train for the majority of the time here in pre-season so far. Everything looks really good so I am absolutely fine. There is no doubt about Bobby’s quality. All the rest we will see how this year goes but he is essential for us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence it has to be seen if Liverpool would extend Firmino's contract if the Brazilian continues his stay at the club for the 22/23 season.\n",
      "Tottenham Hotspur are arguably the most baron club in the \"PL's Big six\". The last time the Spurs won a trophy was back in 2007/08 when they won the EFL Cup. But going into the 2022/23 season, the North London club could finally end their trophyless run, Here's Why...\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spurs signed Antonio Conte after sacking Nuno Espirito Santo in November 2021. At that time, the North London club was struggling in the league and looked set to finish outside the European spots. However, the Italian tactician steadied the ship and helped them finish 4th in the Premier League. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finishing in the Champions League spot certainly brought its fruits. The Spurs' owner Daniel Levy spent big in the summer. Tottenham signed the likes of Ivan Perisic, Richarlison, Djed Spence, Clement Lenglet, Yves Bissouma, and Frazer Forster in order to boost their squad. With Harry Kane and Hueng Min Son firing on all cylinders, Tottenham seem to have covered all the pieces of the jigsaw. \n",
      "\n",
      "To add to this, Antonio Conte organised an intense preseason for the players starting from early July itself. This showed how serious the former Premier League winner was as he wanted to justify his role at the club.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can Tottenham win the Premier League this season? Well, the Spurs do have an outside chance but Liverpool and Manchester City would remain the favourites heading into the league. However, we can expect the club to go deep in the FA Cup and League Cup as we expected them to play their strongest XI in the latter stages. \n",
      "\n",
      "The writer certainly does think so, But It has to be seen if Spurs can actually be the wildcards this season!\n",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta claimed last week that he still hopes to bring Lionel Messi back to the Camp Nou. The Barca president has now added to that and has claimed that the club already has a strategy to bring the Argentine back \"home\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Lionel Messi had to leave Barcelona last summer as the club was unable to pay his salary. Following a failed attempt at a contract renewal, Messi signed for PSG where he did not have a great first season. Though the Argentine is going to stay in Paris for the 2022/23 season, the rumour mill is already running with news of a Barcelona return in 2023. \n",
      "\n",
      "As per Joan Laporta, Barcelona will attempt to bring Messi back in the future. The Barcelona president claimed, \"I have known Messi since he was a kid and I love Leo. I feel in moral debt to Messi. He's the best player in our history and I will do my best in order to ensure he can have the best ending of his career with a Barca shirt on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As per the Mirror, Laporta also added, \"Again, I am telling you this is a wish we have and I hope we can convert it to reality. We have a strategy to get him back to Barcelona. Barca loves Leo, the fans love Leo and I love him, too. I will do my best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lionel Messi's PSG deal would end in June 2023 but the Argentine can extend his contract for another season should he want to do so. Hence it has to be seen what Messi decides to do next season.\n",
      "Barcelona made major moves in the summer as they signed Franck Kessie from AC Milan and Andreas Christensen from Chelsea on free transfers. However, the Spanish giants could now lose out on both their players if they fail to register them in the coming days. \n",
      "\n",
      "Owing to their existing debt, Barcelona have failed to register their summer signings. The club is looking to let go of multiple players including De Jong, and Braithewaite in order to free up their salary cap. But things could backfire if immediate action is not taken! \n",
      "\n",
      "As per ESPN, \"New signings Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie could both leave Barcelona for free if they are not registered before Saturday's LaLiga opener against Rayo Vallecano.\" The report states that if they are not registered before Barca's opening fixture against Rayo, both players could choose to execute a clause that allows them to leave for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barcelona do have time until 31st August 2022 in order to register their seven new signings. But since the duo signed on a free transfer, their clause states that they can leave if needed. If such a situation is to arise, the Barcelona board would have to sit down with the players' managers to sort out the situation in the next couple of days. \n",
      "\n",
      "It has to be seen what Barcelona can do to quench the situation.\n",
      "Neymar and Mbappe had a fallout in the Ligue 1 game between PSG and Marseille last weekend. Sources have since picked up multiple reasons for the eventual fallout between the two superstars and the lead-up to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Neymar denied Mbappe from taking a penalty kick after Mbappe had seen his first effort being saved. This incident sparked a heated debate that even led to the dressing room where Sergio Ramos had to step in to stop the tension from escalating between the players as per reports. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Mirror, Kylian Mbappe is not happy with how much influence Neymar has over the likes of Ramos and Messi in the PSG dressing room. Neymar on the other hand has since liked a couple of posts after the incident that had portrayed Mbappe as the new \"owner\" of PSG.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As per Marca, \"Mbappe is  feeling frustrated that he does not have the power at the club that he had assumed, with the influence that Neymar had over both Messi and Sergio Ramos – the two other heavyweights in the dressing room – said to be a source of discontent.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Dressing room issues have been a constant problem at PSG over the years. Hence the manager would have to spend time with his players in order to make things better if the club are to make this season a standout one.\n",
      "Chelsea are set to be very interested in Frenkie De Jong as they attempt to tempt the midfielder to move to London instead of Manchester. For this, the Blues reportedly have a two-for-one swap deal in mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "As per the Mirror, Thomas Tuchel's side want to revamp their midfield before the 2022/23 season. For this, the Blues have narrowed down their sights on the outgoing Barcelona midfielder Frenkie De Jong. The Dutch midfielder looks set to be heading out of Barca with Manchester United being the prime target. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Chelsea could upset this equation with a newly proposed swap deal. As per the report, \"The Blues could possibly offer current defensive duo Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta in part-exchange for De Jong. Barcelona have of course already been chasing the signings of the Chelsea pair this summer - despite having already sealed the services of Danish defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frenkie De Jong wants to play in the Champions League and hence Chelsea's offer could tempt him to move to the London-based club as Manchester United would not be contesting in the Champions League this season. To add to this, Barcelona's interest in Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta could also play a huge role as the Blues attempt to successfully sign the midfielder this summer.\n",
      "A recent story by The Hindu made a lot of uncomfortable noise as it mentioned 800 Pakistani Hindus leaving India for Pakistan in 2021. It was unsettling to read that Hindus who wanted to stay in India left the country for Pakistan where they are routinely discriminated against. Lack of empathy in India and Covid-19 also played a major role in their return to an unsafe situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 2015-2019, India granted citizenship to 2,668 Pakistani nationals, but these numbers are minuscule compared to the tsunami of people fleeing Pakistan due to religious persecution. Rajasthan houses the maximum number of Pakistani minority migrants—around 25,000, of which 7,500 are in Jodhpur alone. Since the Partition of India, millions of people both Hindus and Muslims migrated but after a few years, the Muslim migration to Pakistan stopped while Hindu migration to India continues till date due to persecution of Hindus at the individual and State-level. \n",

      "Following their impressive transfer window, backed up by their impeccable performance in the pre-season, the optimism surrounding Arsenal FC is merited. The club's new recruitment policy of signing players for the future is working like a charm for the Gunners. Arteta has brought a breath of fresh enthusiasm among the Gunners faithful, and has also successfully bridged the gap between the fans and the club. \n",
      "\n",
      "All eyes were on Arsenal as they kicked off the 22\\23 Premier League campaign against a well-drilled Crystal Palace. If we look back at the previous meetings between the two London clubs, it is evident that Arsenal had fallen victims to the mighty Eagles from Selhurst Park on many occasions. But it was not the case today, as the Gunners buried their past demons and went on to slay the Eagles in a riveting 2-0 win. \n",
      "\n",
      "Arteta set up his Arsenal side in a new tactical way, with the fullbacks, especially their new signing, Zinchenko playing in a much-advanced role. The Spaniard also tweaked his midfield. Xhaka, who formed a defensive cover with Partey in the midfield, was also given a much advanced role. Arsenal's high press was also on point as they sucked Palace back in their half for the entirety of the first half. \n",
      "\n",
      "The gunner's new acquisition, Gabriel Jesus, looked like the missing piece in Arteta's puzzle. Having enjoyed a terrific pre-season, the Brazilian was flamboyant in his first major outing for the gunners. Whereas for their other signing, Zinchenko, he also looked at home in his new colors. The young French prodigy, William Saliba, who returned to the Arsenal lineup, was rock solid at the back. The young French defender enjoyed a terrific loan spell at Marseille and was named the \"Best Young Player\" in Ligue 1 last season. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gabriel Martinelli got the gunners up and running for the 22/23 season when he latched onto a header from Zinchenko to send the Arsenal fans into raptures. Whereas the second was an unfortunate own goal, and the gunners rightfully merited their 2-0 win. This season will be significant for Arteta, as he aspires to take Arsenal back to their glory days.\n",
      "\"Another thrilling season to look forward to\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fairytale start for Liverpool's marquee acquisition, Darwin Nunez. The former Benfica man fired Klopp and Liverpool to their first silverware for the 22\\23 season. The triumph over City sees Klopp achieve another milestone in his illustrious career. The German becomes one of the few managers to win all the major honors in England with Liverpool. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Uruguayan prodigy who rejected United to join Liverpool in a blockbuster £85m move from Benfica was outstanding since his introduction in the second half. Blessed with pace and clever movement, the Urugyuan was a constant menace to the City backline. The former Benfica man adjusted to his new surroundings to perfection. Nunez led the Liverpool press and hurried the City backline into making trivial errors. On another day, Darwin Nunez could've easily scored a hattrick. The Uruguayan was denied twice, firstly by the offside flag and secondly by Dias's hands - which also led to a penalty and Liverpool's second. The mega-money move from Benfica doesn't seem to faze the Urugyuan, as he slotted Liverpool's third and announced himself with a celebration to match. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas for defending champions Manchester City, it is still early days to predict their future. But having played without a recognized striker for the entirety of two seasons did take a toll in today's clash. Their new superstar Haaland looked lost in the City setup. Guardiola and his boys found it difficult to adjust to playing with an out-and-out striker. And it was evident when Haaland, on multiple occasions, made the run behind Liverpool's defense, only to be left frustrated. The City attacking players were slow in spotting Haaland's run and were not on the same page for the entirety of the match. It will be interesting to see how Pep nurtures Haaland into the team. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another exciting City acquisition who stole the limelight from Haaland was Julian Alvarez. The Argentine is loved and earmarked by many to be the next big star from Argentina, given his performances for River Plate. Julian scored the equalizer for City and looked promising in his first major outing.\n",

      "When Jose Mourinho said, \" Finishing 2nd with Manchester United was his biggest achievement\" people mocked the \"special one\" and tagged him as delusional. Fast forward to 2022, and the statement made by the Portuguese seems to be true. When six months ago, Ragnick stated that \"United needs an open heart surgery\" the United board relieved him of his duties. The Austrian had also said that \"United needs to sell ten and buy ten players to compete at a higher level\" Indicating that the current United team does not have what it takes to wear the United jersey.. Again, fast forward to 2022, and Ragnick was right. \n",

      "Brentford made lightwork of Manchester United to add to Ten Hag and United's misery. After losing their opener at Old Trafford to Brighton, this demolition does not come as a surprise. The Red Devils will not forget the first 35 minutes at Glech Community Stadium in haste. Manchester United was not only embarrassed but was torn apart by Brentford. \n",
      "\n",
      "The changes Ten Hag made to the United lineup heavily backfired. The midfield for United was non-existent, and starting Eriksen in the holding midfield role turned out to be a suicide. De Gea's position might also be in jeopardy because of his woeful performance. The Spaniard was deemed by many as not the ideal goalkeeper for Ten Hag. A modern sweeper keeper is what Ten Hag prefers, and De Gea is the opposite. The Spaniard was at fault for the first two goals and seemed uncomfortable while playing out from the back. The performances of the United players have gone from bad to worst. As a result of which, they sit at the bottom of the PL table. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Slogans saying, \"It's time for Glazers to go.\" were displayed openly by the fans in yesterday's clash. The Glazers' have turned a blind eye to the well-functioning of the club. The owners of United have pulled the club, and its well wishers to the dirt. A club whose tales are as old and legendary as time is on the verge of calamity.\n",
      "The NBA world recently mourned the loss of legendary Boston Celtics big man Bill Russell. Following his passing, the NBA decided to retire his No. 6 jersey across the entire NBA, meaning no player will ever wear the number again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are many players who are currently in the NBA and wear the number, including Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James. Instead of forcing all of them to change their number, the league has instead decided that they can continue, and will simply be the last players to ever wear No. 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were 25 players who wore the number last year and they will be the final ones to do so. LeBron is the most notable, but there are other well-known players as well including some former Lakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex Caruso with the Chicago Bulls, Montrezl Harrell with the Washington Wizards, Lance Stephenson with the Indiana Pacers and Lou Williams with the Atlanta Hawks all sported the number as well. Though Harrell was traded to the Charlotte Hornets and changed his number to 8 with his new team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Moses Brown, Gabriel Deck, Hamidou Diallo, Bryn Forbes, Quentin Grimes, Kristaps Porzingis, Kenyon Martin Jr., Jalen McDaniels, Jordan McLaughlin and Keon Johnson are currently have the number and can keep it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaq Buchanan, Zylan Cheathem, David Duke Jr. Melvin Frazier, Kevin Pangos, Javonte Smart, Rayjon Tucker, Luca Vildoza, and Tyrone Wallace round out the list of players who will be the last to sport the same number as the NBA legend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The league deciding to retire the jersey across all teams makes a lot of sense as Russell was a true pioneer whose impact stretched well beyond the Celtics for whom he played. Russell broke barriers as one of the first African-American stars in the NBA and was extremely outspoken about the racial abuse and issues he dealt with. Russell was also the first African-American coach in NBA history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the immense issues that he dealt with, Russell would still become the winningest player ever, capturing 11 NBA Championships in 13 seasons.\n",

      "Shah called for Hyderabad to be “free” of the Nizams—former Muslim rulers whose reign ended 74 years ago in 1948—and reservations for minorities to be abolished. Amidst a sea of BJP flags and banners, Singh, 45, who shared the stage with Shah, said the “Owaisi brothers” (Asaduddin Owaisi and Akbaruddin Owaisi, leaders of the rival All India Majlis- e-Ittehadul Party) should be “thrown out” of the state and Telangana made a “Hindu state”.\n",

With the Tigor and the two SUVs, Tata is now without a doubt India's undisputed leader in the EV industry.

The vlogger and his companion are asked to predict the amount of the vlogger's current electricity bill, which is shown in the video.

Spending the extra few lakhs on an electric car simply does not make sense for consumers with modest monthly operating costs, unless they are willing to pay more for being environmentally responsible. However, the more you drive, the easier it is to make up the difference in price between the hybrid version of the identical vehicle and the ordinary petrol one.\n",

      "Premji took Twitter and wrote, “There is a lot of chatter about people moonlighting in the tech industry. This is cheating - plain and simple. \n",
      "\n",
      "The remark may be in reference to Swiggy, a foodtech startup that recently came under fire for its Moonlight policy, which was widely condemned by online users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moonlighting refers to doing a second job in addition to a regular employment without the knowledge of your primary employer. If the boss discovers that one has been moonlighting, the action is immoral and could result in job loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular employees are allowed to take on side projects or work outside of the office after hours or on their days off according to Swiggy's Moonlight policy. It resembles working a second job in addition to your day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The requirement for employees is that the second employment cannot interfere with the regular job hours. Additionally, prior clearance is required for any initiatives or tasks that could potentially present a conflict of interest or interfere with an employee's job duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a policy was implemented at a time when Foodtech companies were under fire for maintaining a hostile work environment for delivery personnel and paying them less than they were entitled to. Additionally, employees are calling for greater flexibility in working hours as a result of a trend that originated in high paying jobs where hybrid cultures are desired over the antiquated work-from-office norm.\n",

      "To make the maximum number of citizens use public transport, it is time to use technology in a sophisticated way, said Union Road Transport and Highway Minister Nitin Gadkari. Gadkari appealed to the BEST administration in Mumbai to digitize the public transport system as a 70 percent subsidy is received from the Centre for digitalisation. The Union Minister proposed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to build a multi-story bridge to solve the problem of traffic congestion in Mumbai. For the Mumbai-Delhi 12-hour highway journey, cooperation from the state is needed, added Gadkari.\n",
      "\n",
      "If water taxis are introduced to connect with Navi Mumbai airport, it will be reachable in just 17 minutes and it is also pollution free. If BEST takes up this project, it will be beneficial and it is easy to go for a 100-seater fast-speed boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Minister’s advice to BEST is to electrify all buses soon, so the losses will be covered soon. “Government should think about using hydrogen. Flex engine vehicle production has already started. Most of these vehicles are manufactured in Maharashtra. If taxis and Auto rickshaws in Mumbai start using electric or flex engines, it will help reduce pollution. This will also bring financial benefits by reducing the cost of petrol.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gadkari appealed to the Maharashtra government to send proposals for ropeway, cable car, and funicular railway. 165 such schemes have been approved across the country. A double-decker bus that runs on water and in the air can be started in Mumbai by putting a ropeway peeler from Nariman Point, like in the Philippines. For this, he said BEST may start working on a Detailed Project Report (DPR).\n",
      "The first quarter (Q1) of the current fiscal year (FY23) saw strong year-on-year (Y-o-Y) revenue growth for newly listed tech startups like Zomato, Paytm, Nykaa, and MapMyIndia due to increases in gross order value (GOV), strong monetisation in payments, gross merchandise value (GMV), and distinctive new-age deep-tech digital products, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paytm recorded the highest Y-o-Y revenue growth of the four, at 88.5 percent, as the amount increased to Rs 1,679.6 crore compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven by an increase in device subscriptions and accelerated adoption of high-margin businesses like lending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zomato's revenue increased 67 percent YoY to Rs 1,413.90, driven by an increase in revenue per order and a 10 percent sequential growth in GOV to Rs 6,430 crore in the April-June quarter. Strong growth in order volumes and modest growth in average order values when compared to the prior quarter helped GOV maintain its pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third-place finisher in the digital map industry was CE Info Systems, which develops advanced digital maps and operates under the MapMyIndia brand. Its revenue from operations increased by about 50% to Rs 65 crore from the same period last year as a result of the company's provision of services like highly distinctive and exclusive advanced digital maps, SaaS Products, API platforms, and IoT devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "A successful stock market IPO in November of last year helped omnichannel beauty retailer FSN Ecommerce Ventures, also known as Nykaa, expand its sales by 41% year over year to Rs 1,148.4 crore and its gross merchandise value (GMV) by 47% YoY to Rs 2,156 crore. The consolidated GMV of Nykaa has increased at a 61 percent CAGR during the past three years. Owned brand GMV accounted for 11.2 percent of overall GMV.\n",

      "According to a recent survey, religious leaders shouldn't be overly concerned that the increasing accessibility of religious content and activities online will entice Millennials away from places of worship.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, according to researcher Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme, \"Digital Religion Among U.S. and Canadian Millennial Adults,\" a paper published last year in the Review of Religion Research, faith content and activities made available virtually are, in some cases, improving the in-person religious experience for participating Americans and Canadians ages 18 to 35.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We know that more and more people are turning toward digital mediums for spirituality such as chat groups with pastors, online sermons, and religious content on social media,” said Wilkins-Laflamme, a sociologist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. “We’ve found that while digital religion isn’t necessarily attracting a lot of new Millennials to participate, it is making the experience of those already involved richer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stressed that the tendency does not, however, represent most Millennials. However, a sizable portion of the young adult population still practises it, and for many of them, digital religion serves as an essential addition to their in-person religious practise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her research makes a distinction between Millennials who actively publish spiritual themes to online platforms like social media and those who passively receive religious information, such readings and worship, on similar channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subjects were questioned about their participation in such activities over the course of a year. The majority of respondents in the United States who chose \"Not at all\" included 36% who said they did not read religious information online and 53% who said they did not express their spiritual beliefs on social media platforms including Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most other responses, active blogging lagged behind digital content consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "The percentage of millennials who claimed to post something at least once per day (11%) only barely outnumbered content consumers (10 percent ).\n",
      "\n",
      "The statistics, according to Wilkins-Laflamme, show that Americans use digital religion much more frequently than Canadians.\n",
      "Secant Technologies was ordered by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission to compensate a customer for charging an additional amount of 37 as a merchant discount rate (MDR) and to repay the aforementioned extra charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through its managing director, Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana resident Paramjit Singh filed a complaint against Secant Technologies, a division of Litratim MicroSpecialities Private Ltd. (referred to as opposite party).\n",
      "\n",
      "Singh claimed in his complaint, which was made on September 14, 2019, that he had paid the opposing party ₹1,180 in service fees to have a laptop repaired as well as have antivirus software installed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other party also charged 670, but the complainant paid the sum through his debit card in protest. On debit cards, the company added a 2% MDR.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complainant reminded the opposing party of Reserve Bank of India instructions that made it clear that no merchant discount rate was applicable to accounts of ₹2,000 or less, nevertheless the fee was nonetheless imposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaining party claimed there was a lack of service because they charged ₹1,887 rather than ₹1,850.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complainant requested in his complaint that the company pay him ₹50,000 for poor service, ₹1 lakh for unfair business practises, ₹10,000 for legal fees, and a refund of an additional 37 along with interest at a rate of 12% annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opposing party's attorney, however, argued that the lawsuit was fraudulent, frivolous, and had been filed without any legal authority to demand money from the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opposing party further argued that although the complainant claimed to have paid ₹1,887 using his debit card, the payment was really made using a credit card that belonged to one Hartaj Singh. \n",
      "\n",
      "In its order, the commission noted that the other party's issue was with payment and that it hardly mattered if the complaint made the payment using someone else's debit card.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The opposite party was not entitled to charge ₹37 as MDR and in our considered view, it would be just and proper if the opposite party is made to refund ₹37 charged from the complainant, along with a composite compensation of ₹2,000,” the order read.\n",

He then placed the models, including his wife, trying to loosely coordinate their outfits into the 30 windows. Some were bold enough to stand on the window jam and some were framed by window.

      "“Now this is wild and somehow more remote country than what I have ever seen before,” Michael wrote. In many ways, the Asmat world at the time was a mirror image of every taboo of the West.

They killed their neighbours, and they hunted human heads and ate human flesh.\n",

      "Anything outside of the tangible immediacy of what the Asmats could see had to come from that spirit world—it was the only comprehensible explanation.

      "The psychoactive effects of mad honey stem not from bees but from what bees feed on in certain regions: a genus of flowering plants called rhododendrons. All species of these plants contain a group of neurotoxic compounds called grayanotoxins. When bees feed on the nectar and pollen of certain types of rhododendrons, the insects ingest grayanotoxins, which eventually make their way into the bees’ honey, effectively making it “mad.”\n",

      "At White Sands, we find many remarkable fossilized footprints scattered across Lake Otero. While these footprints are ancient, scientists are still uncovering new evidence of past life.\n",
      "   Tens of thousands of years ago, during the ice age, a giant body of water, Lake Otero, rested within the Tularosa basin. The climate was less arid, and the vegetation was abundant. One could have seen grasslands stretching for miles that would have looked more like the prairies of the Midwest rather than New Mexico’s deserts.\n",
      "   This paradise of lush green life naturally captured the attention of the larger animals of the ice age. Plant eaters such as ancient camels, Columbian mammoths and Harlan’s ground sloth came to Lake Otero to feast on the grasses and trees of the Tularosa Basin. This attracted fearsome predators known as the dire wolf and American Lion. These animals’ footprints remained long after their departure of the wetlands of Lake Otero and eventually became fossilized.\n",
      "   The latest research shows that humans have been living in North America and Tularosa Basin for at least 23,000 years. It was previously thought that humans arrived in North America closer to 13,500 – 16,000 years ago. Research was conducted to see what could be found below the surface by digging a trench in the gypsum soil on the park’s western playa. Human Footprints were found within different layers of sediment below the surface of the dig site. Above and below these footprints were ancient grass seeds (Ruppia cirrhosa) which were analyzed using radiocarbon dating. It was revealed that the calibrated dates were of 22,860 (∓320) and 21,130 (∓250) years ago.\n",

Four years later, Falk, who was both the sole writer and illustrator of his creation, found a publisher who was able to syndicate his work to daily newspapers across the United States. And with that, Mandrake, the master of illusion, became what is considered the first superhero comic strip ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "First published in 1934, right in the middle of the great depression, Mandrake’s comics were quite a significant departure from the kind of comic characters and stories that were popular at the time.

      "A key theme of the stories of Mandrake appears to be rooted in his relationship with his family. It is no coincidence that many of Mandrake’s key allies, as well as the villains he faced, were often directly related to him. While his father Theron and half-sister Lenore join in his adventures occasionally, no less than three major villains, including his arch nemesis, are either direct relatives (or a dark reflection of himself).\n",

      "In August 1720, the East India Company’s Council in Bombay received a letter from their factors and merchants based in the city of Mocha. They had expected this letter for some time. It was the practice for the factory’s staff to report on their activities regularly as Mocha was the entrepôt for the coffee markets of Yemen, in which the Company had invested heavily.\n",

      "With this letter came a list of the factory’s expenses, the salaries of guards and domestic servants, the pay given to the company’s four merchants and the costs of running the factory itself. One of the largest of these was the expenses incurred in maintaining the factory’s “Table” that amounted per month to nearly 300 Spanish dollars (the famous piece of eight).\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a considerable sum to feed the factory’s 22 residents, including the Eurasian “topas” and “peon” guards. Access to the table was also open to visiting English merchants and ships’ officers when they were present in the port, making it a space for social interactions in addition to eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The records kept by the Mocha factors tell us a great deal about what the table would have been laden with. For the most part, it seems like fairly standard fare for an early modern English kitchen: greens, salt, beef, onions, limes, mutton and fresh fish appear regularly, as do fowls, chickens, pigeons and eggs. To this menu was added some local flavours, with limes, “spice” and “temper”.\n",

      "Green, who was born in 1834 to a wealthy Massachusetts Quaker family, took her family’s talent for money to a new level. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before she was born, Green’s family “had made millions with their whaling fleet and shipping interests,” Terrell writes. Her grandfather, Gideon Howland, passed on that skill set to her. When she was still young, he “would talk to her about financial matters and encourage her to read financial papers,” Terrell writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time she was 13, Green had taken over accounting for the family business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green’s father bought her “a wardrobe full of the finest dresses of the seas in order to attract a wealthy suitor. Green sold her new wardrobe and bought government bonds with the proceeds.\n",

      "Green did marry, to a man named Edward Henry Green, but their marriage included the unusual step of a pre-nup, which protected Green’s fortune. She had two children, and groomed her son Edward to take over the fortune, writes Oneill, after her husband died young.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most memorable image of Green–and the one that earned her the sobriquet “witch”–came after the death of her husband, when she started wearing mourning clothes. And her fixation with making and maintaining money grew and grew, to the point where she wouldn’t seek medical attention for herself or her children because of the cost, and they all lived in cheap housing and moved frequently.\n",

I did not have any idea about judo, but there was a martial arts academy near our house. It was complete luck that it was a judo academy. It was run by a woman and was relatively cheap. I knew Tulika could at least spend two hours a day there,” said Amrita.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially meant for just daycare, Tulika found a home as a judoka.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is further to the tale. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tulika's progress as a national-level player was happening in fits and starts. The mother and daughter pestered Yashpal Solanki, the best Judo coach in the country, to coach Tulika. \n",
      "\n",
      "Solanki had joined SAI in Bhopal. Tulika, with her mother’s support, followed. For Amrita, it was a simple decision. “When I was a young girl, I was the first in my family to get a job and become independent. When Tulika said she wanted to go to a different city to pursue her judo, I couldn’t say no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Tulika’s judo career blossomed, her expenses rose, and Amrita, a single parent, kept paying from her salary, even withdrawing money from her PF. \n",

      "On March 14, 2020 — when the uncertainty around COVID-19 was near its peak — Mr Morrison made himself, effectively, a secondary health minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasoning he gave in a press conference on Wednesday was that the health minister carried incredible special emergency powers under the Biosecurity Act, and some of it was being put to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finance\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 30, 2020, Mr Morrison also took on the powers of the finance minister, who at the time was Mathias Cormann.\n",
      "\n",
      "At his press conference, Mr Morrison argued there were \"massive financial delegations\" available only to the finance minister and — like the health minister — precautions needed to be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finance minister is different to the treasurer. The former is responsible for the machinery of government, how all the various public service functions work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a big, important and influential role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treasury and home affairs\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a year later, two more significant appointments were made. \n",

      "That budget outlines how federal government money is spent.\n",

      "It remains to be seen how many supporters the minor party will be able to win over with its bold new plan — but here's how it says it would work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why has it been introduced?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pets and wildlife are not getting the care they need because animal owners and rescuers simply cannot afford it, according to the Animal Justice Party leader Andy Meddick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Victoria has a vet shortage crisis, and it is not just creating animal welfare issues, it is driving up prices and placing unimaginable pressure on vets to work overtime, unsupported,\" Mr Meddick said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just like we can visit our doctor with a Medicare card, Veticare creates public clinics allowing for free or low-cost appointments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Penny Hocking has been a vet for more than three decades and said Veticare could make a huge difference, particularly in rural and regional areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some people are driving hours to get vet care in regional Victoria, because there is very limited after-hours services there and in the cities it can be very expensive,\" she said.\n",

      "\"When people cannot afford vet care, not only does the animal not get adequate care but often they can be euthanised or surrendered to a rescue group who are burdened with the vet expenses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What would it cover and how would it work?\n",
      "\n",

      "So we know the importance of applying sun screen, especially during those summer days. But simply applying it also won't do, as incorrectly applied can leave areas of the skin exposed to the sun and harmful UV light. Applying sunscreen rightly means fully covering all the areas of the skin that cam be exposed and reapplying them as often as necessary to maintain a safe level of UV protection. \n",

      "Follow these simple steps to easily apply sunscreen on your face and body: \n",

      "STEP 1: APPLY YOUR SUNSCREEN BEFORE YOU GO OUT \n",

      "STEP 4: ADD AN EXTRA FEW DOTS \n",
      "\n",
