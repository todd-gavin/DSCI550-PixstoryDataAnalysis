    "- Jaccard similarity: The ratio of the number of common elements between the sets to the total number of distinct elements in both sets. The Jaccard similarity coefficient can range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 means that the two sets have no elements in common, and a value of 1 means that the two sets are identical.\n",
